      "I strongly recommend that you focus on making your poor hearts every day more pleasing to our divine Teacher and to act in a way that this current year will be more productive than last year in terms of good deeds. The reason being is that as time passes a nd the end approaches, it is necessary to double our enthusiasm and to raise our spirit in God, serving him with greatest diligence in everything that both our vocation and Christian devotion demand of us. Only this can be pleasing to God. Only this can li berate us from the enormous world that is not of God and can free us from our enemies. Only this, therefore, can lead us to the threshold of eternal salvation. We should also face the tests of our current life to which the divine providence will be delivering, but we should not discourage or anguish. We must bravely fight, and we will receive the reward that God has kept for strong souls. Remember, daughters, the  world that our divine Teacher said one day to his disciples and that today he says to you: “Let your heart not be troubled”. Yes, daughters, do not let your hearts be discouraged at the moment of the test because Jesus has promised his undoubted help to t hose who follow him.  (...)"

      "To be able to continuously live a life of devotion, you only need to accept in your heart some great and generous precepts: The first one that I would like you to consider is the one of Saint Paul: “Everything reverts in goodness to those who love God”. And, let me mention, since God can and knows how to bring goodness even from evil: with whom would he do such but with those who, without hesitation whatsoever, give themselves to Him? Even sins, from which God with his infinite goodness keep us far from, are commanded by his divine providence for the sake of those who believe and serve him. Had the saint King David not sinned, he would have never gained such profound  humility. Magdalene would have not loved Jesus so devotedly had he not forgave her many sins. And Jesus would have not been able to forgive those sins had Magdalene not committed them. Please consider, dear daughter, this great work of divine mercy: He transforms our miseries in favors and, with the venom of our actions, he performs healthy changes in our souls.  Tell me then, what would he not do with his grace to our afflictions, our s uffering and the troubles that anguish us? And, therefore, even if you do not experience any affliction of any type, believe that, if you believe in God with all your heart, everything will be transformed into good; and even if you do not understand what this goodness will come from, be certain that it will arrive.  If God puts in front of your eyes the mud of a disgrace, it’s only to provide you with a clearer view and to make you more admirable to the eyes of his angels, like a magnificent and generous sp ectacle.  And, if God makes you fall, it is to achieve in you what he achieved in Saint Paul when he fell from his horse. profound humility. To lose heart and to become impatient after making a mistake is the plan of the enemy, is to grant him the weapons, is to surrender. Therefore, you should not do that because the grace of God is always ready to rescue you."

      "The third precept that I would like that you to engrave forever in your spirit is that God is our father: and what could you fear if you are the daughter of the father, without whose providence even a hair from your hair would not fall off? Isn't it actual ly very odd that, being us the children of the father, we would have other thoughts rather than to love him and serve him? Take care and be in control of your soul and of your family the way he wants and do not be concerned. If you do so, you will see how Jesus takes care of you. Jesus once said to Saint Catherine of Sienna ‘Think of me and I will think of you’. A wise person would say ‘Eternal father, your providence rules over everything’."

      "The third precept is that you should observe what the divine Teacher taught his disciples: “What have you lacked?”. Carefully consider, my good little daughter, this passage. Jesus sent the disciples throughout the world, without money, without a cane, without sandals, without saddles, clothes, just with a tunic. And he later told them: “When I sent you on that journey,  were you in lack of anything?”. And they replied that they had lacked nothing. Today, I tell you, little daughter: when you were tormented, even in times when, unfortunately, you didn’t trust much in God, tell me “Did you ever find yourself oppressed by suffering?” You will tell me in the negative. And why -and I will add -, not havin g trust in overcoming all the rest of adversities? If God has not abandoned you in the past, how would he abandon you in the future when now, more than in the past, you want to belong to him from now onwards? Do not fear that something bad could happen you, God will give you the strength to overcome it. The divine Teacher sent Saint Peter to walk over water. When the wind blew and facing the danger of the s torm, Saint Peter was afraid and that made him almost drown. He asked the Teacher for help, and he replied to him saying: “Man of little faith, why have you doubted?”, and extending his hand he held Peter. If God makes you walk over the tempest waters of a dversity, do not doubt, my little daughter, God is with you, be brave and you will be saved."

      "The fourth precept is that of eternity. Little should be of importance to God’s children to live these most brief moments that pass by as long as they can live in eternal glory with God. Little daughter, consider that you are already on the path to eternit y, that you have already set foot on it. As long as eternity is a happy one as a consequence of your deeds, should it be important that these transitory moments are of suffering? The fifth precept that I plead that you keep fixed in your mind is that of the apostle St. Paul: “Keep in mind that I do not focus on anything else but in the cross of my Jesus”. Keep in your heart, little daughter, our crucified Jesus and every cross of the world will seem like roses. Those who have felt the pain of the crown of thorns of our Savior, who is our Head, will not feel any other wounds whatsoever."

But it is in vain that I fix my eyes to capture the emergence of such a luminous phenomenon. The more I look for it, the less I see, the more I try and the more fervently I look for it, the more I see myself covered by darkness. I’m alone in the day, I’m alone during the night and no ray of light comes to shine on me, never a drop of freshness comes to put off the flame that engulfs me continuously without ever consuming me. Only once have I felt, in the most intimate and secret part of my spirit, something very delicate that I don’t know how to explain. The soul started to feel his presence without being able to see it, and, right away, let me explain it that way, he came so intimately to my soul that it clearly perceived his touch. This was exactly -to paint a vague idea - as it usually happens when our body touches very closely another body. I don’t know what else to say about this. I can only confess that, at first, I was controlled by panic but this panic, little by little, transformed into a celestial euphoria. I felt as if I were no longer in a worldly state and I wouldn’t be able to say i f, at the moment this was occurring, I felt or not as part of my own body, only God knows. I wouldn’t be able to tell further to better explain this event."

And if he sometimes doesn’t let you feel the sweetness of this love, he does it to bring you to a greatest humility and so that you realize how unworthy you are. But do not stop asking for his  holy kindness with all your trust, particularly during the time that we represent him as a little child in Bethlehem. Because, why, little daughter, would He maintain that tender and kind condition if not to lead us to love him trustingly and to give ours elves to Him? Stay close to the cradle of this gracious child, especially during the holy days of his birth. If you love richness, you will find here the gold that the Magi Kings brought to him; if you love the smoke of the honorable, here you will find that incense; an d if you love the refinement of the senses, you will sense the aromatic myrrh that perfumes the entire grotto. Be rich in the love of this celestial child, be respectful to the familiarity you will have with him through prayer and be delicate in the happiness you will feel in holy inspirations and in the feeling that you are only his. Maintain a good spirit regarding your little resentments and your failures, they will without doubt pass. And if they don’t pass, they will be an exercise of humility and a way to pay for your sins.

The blaze is burning, the air is full of dense clouds, and the spirit doesn’t see or understand anything.  But God speaks and is present in the soul that feels, understands, loves, and shivers. Little daughters, be happy, don’t expect to go to Mount Tabor to see God. You can see him at Mount Sinai. I believe yours is not the interior and upset stomach that is not capable of loving goodness. Your stomach can only like the highest goodness itself a nd not just its virtues. That is the reason why your stomach cannot be satisfied with what is not God. The knowledge of your interior indignity and deformity is the purest light that comes from the divine. This light allows you to consider your being divine as well as your capacity to commit any crime without its grace. This light is a great mercy of God, and it was granted to the greatest saints, because it allows the soul to stay away from any feeling of vanity and pride, making humility greater, which is the foundation of true virtue and of Christian perfection. Saint Teresa also had this knowledge and she expressed that, at certain times, it is so painful and horrible that it could cause death if the Lord wouldn’t support one’s heart."

The first one makes the creature acceptable and pleasing to the eyes of the Most High. The second one makes it disgusting because it is the reflection of inequity present in the soul, in the conscience. Daughters, in the darkness in which you are most of the time, you confuse one indignity with the other one.

He is also delighted that in his body, even in the middle of all the chains to which he is tied to, Jesus will always be glorified. If he survives, he will exalt Jesus Christ thr ough his own life and his preaching, also being in jail, as he had already been doing until then, preaching the word of Jesus Christ to those of the praetorium. If, instead, he is martyrized, he will glorify Jesus Christ by offering him the highest testimo ny of his love. Therefore, he openly declares that his life is Christ, that for him is his soul and the center of all his existence, the motor of all his actions, the goal of all his aspirations. And, after having said that his life is Jesus Christ, he also adds that his death would be an accomplishment for him because with his martyrdom he will give Jesus solemn testimony of his love, he will obtain that his union with Jesus be more unbreakable and the glory that awaits him will also be greater. What do you think, Raffaelina, of this way of talking? Worldly souls, not having any knowledge of supernatural and celestial choices, when listening to such language, would laugh and would be right to do so! Because the worldly being, says the Holy Spirit,  does not perceive things that are of God. They, poor them, have no other choices that are not of mud and dust, they cannot conceive the idea of happiness that spiritual souls say to experience when suffering or dying for Jesus Christ. How much better for them if, instead of laughing or being surprised, they would recognize their guilt and they would admire, at least in respectful silence, the affectionate devotion of such souls whose hearts are full of divine love!"

      "For Saint Paul these two feelings originated from perfect charity. Being free to follow Jesus in perfect union in the glory, which was great for him, because he felt happier than living on this earth. And this desire was uniquely motivated by perfect chari ty he felt for his God. On the other hand, the other feeling or desire also originated from a perfect virtue, but which had as immediate objective the neighbor’s salvation. In other words, this vocation was motivated by the main objective, God, but it was achieved as the result of the salvation of souls. Regarding the first wish, the one of being freed from his body, Saint Paul finds it more useful for him and he wants it with the fire that a just soul can wish to be one with its God. On the other hand, the second wish, the one of continuing to live in the  middle of tasks and work to achieve the salvation of souls, he, full of the spirit of Jesus Christ, sees it as more necessary for others. After having had a revelation (as one can conclude from what he expresses afterwards, and the event confirms my inter pretation because he was not martyred because he was freed) that he was not going to die, Saint Paul accepts and assumes his love to God by working for the salvation of souls. As a son who tenderly loves the father, he accepts, for the love he has for him,  to be subject to all humiliation and he also accepts some extremely low services that his father would ask of him. This loving son does everything, not to go against the wishes of his father but rather to make sure he would please him completely."

      "Keep your spirits high, abandon yourself in the divine heart of Jesus. Leave all your concerns to him. Put yourself always in the last place of the group that loves the Lord, considering everyone better than you. Be truly humble with others because God rej ects the arrogant and gives grace to the humble one. The more the grace and favors of Jesus grow in your heart, the more you should be humble, imitating always the humility of our Mother in heaven who, the moment she became the Mother of God, she declares herself servant and slave of God himself. When good and bad things happen to you, humble yourself always under the powerful hand of God, accepting with humility and patience not only those things that are of your pleasing, but also, and with humility and p atience, all tribulations that He sends you to make you more pleasing to Him and more deserving of the celestial home. Being tempted is an evident sign that the soul is very pleasing to the Lord. Accept, then, everything with a grateful attitude. Don’t believe that this is only my opinion, no, it was the Lord himself who gave his divine word: “And because you are pleasing to God -says the angel to Tobias (and to Tobias in representation of all souls pleasing to God) - it was necessary that you were tested by temptation”. Be happy, then, dear daughter in Jesus. Be also happy, also, even in the middle of temptations and tribulations, knowing well that all of this is a unique gift that the goodness of the Father in heaven gives to your soul. And be grateful always, for everyt hing, to such a good Father, through his most beloved Son Jesus Christ."

      "Dear daughter, let’s convince ourselves and accept this great and terrible truth: self -love never dies before we die. This sad truth certainly pains us, which we have inherited as punishment for the original sin, but it is necessary to accept it and to be patient with ourselves. And, with such patience, according to divine teaching, we will possess our soul. A possession is more stable when it’s less mixed  with concerns and problems, also related to our imperfections. The attacks of the senses and secret actions of self -love will always be felt if we are on this earth. In order not to offend God and not to stain the soul, it’s enough not to give our permission with deliberate will. This virtue of indifference is of such  excellence that not even the old man, nor the most sensitive side, nor human nature with its natural faculties have been able to achieve it. Even the divine Teacher, as son of Adam, even though exempt of all sin, and even if it seemed to the contrary, was  not able to be indifferent to his sensitive side and according to his natural faculties. On the contrary, he did not wish to die on the cross because such indifference was reserved to the fruit of the cross itself, in other words, the spirit, the superior  side, the faculties given by grace. Therefore, dear little daughter, be at peace. When it happens that you break the requirements of indifference in circumstances that require indifference, due to impulse of self -love and of this earth feelings, kneel, as soon as possible, with your heart in  front of God and ask him with trust and humility: “Lord, I ask for your mercy because I am a poor sick one”. Afterwards, stand up in peace and, with calm and serene demeanor, and with holy indifference, continue with your activities."

It is true that six weeks would have been more than enough for this journey, and they wouldn’t know why God would lead them towards treacherous and difficult paths. And everyone who revolted died before getting to the promised land. Even Moses, who was the greatest friend of God, died at the border with the  promised land and was only able to see it from afar without being able to enjoy it. Do not get fixated on the path you step on, keep your eyes on who guides you and on the celestial home to which He leads you.

There is one more source of merit for you. Humble yourself in front of the good God. Ask continuously of him the grace to be able to leave the state of sickness and of weaknesses, wish it fervently and don’t stop doing what is neede d for you to get better. In the meantime, if you wish to be perfect, be patient when facing your imperfections. This is a very important point for the soul that has professed to seek perfection. “In your patience -says the divine Teacher - you will possess your soul”. Therefore, be  patient when facing yourself and facing your own illnesses. In the meantime, be creative when putting into practice the means you are familiar with and that you have learned from me and from others. Your misery and your weaknesses should not scare you because Jesus has seen you under worse circumstances and he still didn’t reject you due to them. And he would not reject you now even more that you are trying to get better by all means. Divine mercy has never rejected this kind of misery. On the contrary, it  grants its grace allowing the throne of its glory over ambition and meanness."

This is also loved by God because it allows the soul to acquire true devotion which consists of a will determined to put into practice what leads to the service of God without personal satisfaction.

The soul that finds itself in this stage should not under any circumstance lose hope, it should not stop doing anything that it used to do in times of spiritual consolation.

But God, in his kindness, feels sorry for us, he feels even pleased also by this little good and accepts the preparation of our hearts. But what is this preparation of our hearts? According to the divine wo rd, God is infinitely bigger than our heart and this overcomes all other realities when, not worrying about himself, the heart is prepared for the service it should offer to God. In other words, the heart accepts the compromise of serving God, of loving hi m, of loving the other, of observing the mortification of the external and internal senses and other good intentions.

All of this, dear daughter, is not in any way proportionate to the greatness of God, which is infinitely greater than the entire universe, than our cap abilities, than our external actions.

Here there are, dear daughter, som e good preparations. It is true that some might not deem much greater preparations necessary in order to serve God, but it is also necessary to find someone who could perform such preparations because, when we are ready to put them into practice, it is eas y to stop seeing that in us these perfections cannot be neither that high nor that absolute.

God himself has s olemnly proclaimed it in the Holy Scripture: “God is loyal, he shall not allow you to be tempted against your own strength. Moreover, with temptation, he will give you enough strength to overcome it”. Paul also worried and asked to be freed from the hard test of the flesh: he was very afraid to succumb, but was he not guaranteed that the help of grace would always be enough? Our enemy, sworn to hurt us, wishes to persuade you of completely the opposite, but you should reject him in the name of Jesus, and laugh hard at him.

The third one is that these celestial beams pr oduce in the soul a rejection to worldly realities, which is every time worst, except for only those that could be useful for the service to God. Therefore, if such rays of light produce these three effects in the soul, keep them as coming from God. These effects cannot at all be produced by the soul nor by the enemy and less by our fantasy and our imagination."

      "Strengthen yourself with the eucharistic sacrament. Amid so many troubles, your soul should not stop singing frequently to God the hymn of adoration and praise. Live always away from the corruption of the worldly Jerusalem, of profane gatherings, of corrup t spectacles and of corrupt people, away from all societies of the impure ones. Prepare your lips, as the divine Redeemer did, and continue drinking from him from the black waters of the Kidron Valley, accepting suffering and penance with pious resignation. Cross with Jesus this river, with suffering with persistence and courage the r ejection by the world because of your love to Jesus. Live in prayer and have your life hidden in Jesus and be with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, that is, in the silence of meditation and prayer. Do not fear neither the darkness nor the night of humili ation and of loneliness, nor the increase of mortifications. Keep going, always, Raffaelina. The bitterness of the river of mortification should not stop you. The persecution by the mundane ones and by all who do not live of the spirit of Jesus Christ shou ld not keep you away from the path that the saints have walked. Always run by the edge of the mount of sanctity and do not despair when walking on the dangerous path. Continue to walk next to Jesus and yes, following him you are safe from everything. It is  also very true that you will triumph, as always, in everything."

      "Jesus, the man of sufferings, would have liked that all Christian imitated him. And Jesus offered that cup also to me and I accepted it. That is the reason why he does not leave me. My poor suffering is good for nothing, but Jesus is pleased by it because I love him so intensely here on earth. That is why, on certain special days, on which he suffered more intensely on this earth, he makes me feel this suffering with even more intensity. Wouldn't that be enough for me to feel humiliated and to seek to live hiding from the eyes of men because I have made myself worthy of suffering with Jesus and like Jesus? Oh, dear father, I feel that my lack of gratitude to the majesty of God is too great."

Do pronounce this fiat like him, both during good and prosperous times as in times of adversity. And do not feel anxious nor break your head thinking of the cross. However, this does not mean that the soul has not been submitted to God’s will, when we see it putting into practi ce such God’s will, even when feeling the powerful force that it must fight against. Would you like to have concrete proof of how the will pronounces its fiat? Virtue is known by its opposite. Delivered by God in the form of a test, being this a difficult or a simple one, tell me: “do you feel moved to rebel against God? Or, better, let’s think as an example the most impossible one: you try to rebel. Or tell me , ‘don’t you tremendously fear even thinking such blasphemous words? Let me tell you that, between the yes and the no, there is, and it cannot happen, anything in between. If your will runs away from rebellion, be assured that it is subject, tacitly, or expressly, to God’s will and, consequently, your will also pronounces, in a way, its  fiat."

      "Saint Paul warns us that “those who are good Christians have crucified their flesh with vices and lustfulness”. From this saint Apostle one can conclude that he who wishes to be a true Christian, in other words, lives with the spirit of Jesus Christ, should mortify his flesh, not for other objective,  but as devotion to Jesus, who for the love for us wanted to mortify all his limbs on the cross. That mortification should be stable, sturdy, and constant and it should be sustained for a lifetime. Moreover, the perfect Christian should not be content by a  mortification harsh only in appearance, but this should also be a painful one. That is the way in which the mortification of the flesh should be conducted, because the Apostle, for that reason called it crucifixion. But someone could contradict us: why so much harshness against the flesh? Foolish you, if you were to carefully reflect  on what you say, you would understand that every pain that your soul suffers comes from not having known or having wanted to mortify the flesh in the way it should be done. If one wishes to be cured in depth, at the root, it is necessary to control, to cr ucify the flesh because it is such the cause of every malaise. The Apostle also adds that to the crucifixion of the flesh should be joined the crucifixion of vices and lustfulness. It should be known that vices are all sinful habits. Lustfulness is our feelings of passion. It is necessary to constantly mortify and cru cify both of them, so they don’t make the flesh sin. He who only mortifies the flesh is like the fool who builds without a foundation."

      "Vanity is an enemy that lurks around all souls that have consecrated themselves to the Lord and that have given themselves to spiritual life. Therefore, it could be called, with much reason, the stain of the soul that tries to be perfect. It has been called in an accurate manner by saints the woodworm of sanctity. Our Lord, with the intention to show us how much vanity could be contrary to perfection, reprimands us the same way that he reprimanded the apostles when he saw them full of self -complacency and vanity, when demons were obeying the orders, they were giving  them: “However, you should not be happy because demons obey you”. And in order to eradicate completely from their minds the sad effects of this evil vice, which tends to insinuate itself in the hearts of people, Jesus scared the apostles by showing them the example of Lucifer, fallen from the heights of heaven due to the  vain complacency in which he fell after receiving the great praise by God: “I could see Satan falling from heaven like lightning”. This vice should be feared even more because there is no virtue contrary to it to fight it. Indeed, every vice has its remedy and a virtue contrary to it. Anger is fought by gentleness, envy by charity, arrogance by humility, etc. Only vanity does not have  a virtue contrary to it. Vanity insinuates itself in most holy acts. And, even within humility if one is not attentive, it plants its roots with arrogance."

      "Saint Chrysostom, talking about vanity, says: “The more work you do, seeking to destroy vanity, the more you stimulate it”. And what is the reason for this? Let the saint doctor tell us himself: “Because everything evil comes from evil, only vanity comes from good, therefore, it doesn’t die when you fight it with good, it becomes bigger”. The devil, dear father, knows very well that a lustful person, a thief, a miser, a sinner has more reasons to feel ashamed and to blush than to feel vain, proud of himself. Therefore, the devil is very careful not to tempt them on that side, saving them fr om that fight. But he doesn’t save that fight to good people, especially those who devote themselves to perfection. All other vices attach themselves to those who have been conquered and controlled by such vices, but vanity lifts its head precisely in thos e people who try to fight it and conquer it. Vanity feels brave when assaulting its enemies, using the same victories that have been achieved against it. This is an enemy that never stops. It is an enemy that enters battle in all our works and that, if one  is not vigilant, makes us his victims. Indeed, to run from the praises of others, we prefer hidden and secret fasting rather than visible ones, silence rather than eloquent speeches, being hated instead of being considered by others, insults rather than honors. Oh, my Lord, even on this, vanity  wishes, as it usually is said, to put its nose, insinuating to us with vain complacencies."

      "Saint Jerome was very right when he compared vanity with shadow. In fact, the shadow follows the body everywhere and it even measures every step. The body runs away, the shadow runs away as well, the body slows down, the shadow does the same, the body sits and then the shadow also assumes the same position. The same happens with vanity, it follows virtue everywhere. In vain the body would try to run away from the shadow. It is always there and everywhere; it follows the body, and it walks by its side. The same happens to someone who has devoted himself to virtue, to p erfection. The more one runs from vanity, the more it is praised by it. We should all fear, dear father, this great enemy of ours. It should be even more feared by those chosen souls because this enemy is in a way something unobliterable. Be always alert, this powerful enemy should not be allowed to enter the mind and the heart because, if it finds its way in, it will deflower all virtues, it corrodes sanctity, it spoils everything that is beautiful and kind. Try to ask continuously to God for the grace of finding yourself protected from this rancid vice because “Every perfect gift comes from above, from the Father of lights”. Open your hearts to the trust in God. Remember always that everything that is good in  your heart is only a gift of the highest goodness from the celestial Husband."

When you feel tempted to vanity, repeat with Saint Bernard: “Neither because of you I started this, neither because of you I will stop doing it”. Didn’t I start my journey by the path of the Lord? Therefore, I wish to continue on them, on that path I will continue walking. If the enemy attacks you because of the sanctity of your life, let others scream to your face and reply: My sanctity is not the fruit of my spirit but it is the fruit of God who sanctifies me, it is a gift from God, it is a talent that my  Husband has lent me for me to negotiate with Him to later give him strict account of the profit achieved."

      "To those worldly ones it seems incredible that there are souls that suffer when providence lets them live long lives. However, such is the story of the saints, which is and will be humanity's teaching. From the horrible suffering of the just souls when seeing themselves far from their center we can have a vague idea, dear Raffaelina, of how those souls suffer, even when having to satisfy their most vital life needs, such as eating, drinking, and sleeping . The mercy of God comes to help them, especially in certain moments and in certain days, with some kind of miracle, not allowing them to reflect properly when they perform such necessary acts of life. The poor souls experience such torture when performing  such actions that they can’t avoid. I am certain, although I wouldn’t be able to find the proper comparison, they experienced something similar to what the martyrs experienced when they were burned alive, giving that way their lives to Jesus as testimony of their faith. Someone could easily say that this comparison is a beautiful and empty exaggeration, but I, dear Raffaelina, know what I tell myself. On the day of the last judgment, we will certainly see those souls who, without having offered their blood for their faith , will be crowned, just like the martyrs, with the palm of martyrdom."

On certain moments I feel wanting to scream like the Apostle did, “poor me!”, not with the same perfection: “It’s no longer me who lives”, because I feel as if there were someone else living in me. Another effect of this grace is that my life is becoming cruel torture, and I only find consolation when I resign myself to living for the love of Jesus. Although, poor me!, because, dear father, in this consolation, at certain moments, I also feel unbeara ble pain, because the soul would like for life to be always made of crosses and persecution. The very natural acts, like eating, drinking, sleeping are for me very painful. The soul, in such a state, cries because hours pass too slowly. At the end of every day, it feels lighter and relieved from a heavy burden. At the same time, it falls again int o profound sadness thinking of its many days of exile. And it’s precisely on such moments when the soul wishes to scream “Oh life, how cruel you are to me!, how long you are!” Oh life, you are no longer life to me but torture! Oh death, I don’t know who ca n fear you because thanks to you our life opens!” Before the Lord honored me with this grace, the pain of my sins, the pain that I felt when seeing the Lord being offended, the plenty of affection I felt for God were not as intense as to make me get out of myself and, sometimes, I felt this pain was unbea rable, and I would give vent  by screaming loudly, without being able to control myself. But after receiving this grace, the pain has become even greater, making me feel as if my heart would jump from one side to another. I now seem to understand how difficult the martyrdom of our most dear Mother was, something I was not able to understand before. If only men could understand this suffering! Who could stand to suffer along with our loved co -redeemer? Who would deny her the  most beautiful title of “Queen of the martyrs”?"

This seems impossible to me, especially when it is the case of a priest, a religious person. Perhaps the souls who say not to feel this fire do not feel it because, perhaps, their heart is larger. Only by this benign interpretation I am able not to call them by the shameful adjective of liars. There are moments in which it comes to my mind the severity of Jesus, and it’s then when I suffer bitterly. I try to remember his pleasantries, and this fills me with joy.

I have such trust in Jesus that, even if I looked at hell open in front of me and I would be on the edge of an abyss, I would not doubt, I would not despair, I would trust in him. Such is the trust that his kindness inspires in me. When I think about the great battles against the devil which, with divine help, I have overcome, there are so many that I would not be able to count them. Who knows how many times my faith would have doubted and me and my hope and my kindness would have been weakened, had he not stretched his hand to me. And my intellect would have been darkened if Jesus, the eternal sun, would have not shine on it! I also realize that I am completely the work of his infinite love. He has denied nothing to me.

It is just a most subtle thread that keeps the spirit trapped, but which stops it, and in a significant manner, from ascending on its path to perfection and from acting with holy freedom. It is a serious offense which the soul commits against our celestial  Husband, and, therefore, the sweetest Lord has deprived us of so many favors only because the door of our heart is not open to him with holy trust. The soul, if it doesn’t decide to leave such a state, brings on itself many punishments. Dear father, do not think that what I tell you is an exaggeration. Let us remember the largely numerous people of God in the desert. Because of their lack of trust, very few ended up setting foot in the promised land.

      "It is great to hope to obtain the highest Christian perfection, but one should not think excessively about it, but rather about one 's conversion and one’s progress towards such perfection in our daily events, leaving the success of our wish to God’s providence. And we should abandon ourselves in the arms of our father, the way a little child would do when he grows up. He eats every day what his father makes, trusting that he will not lack food according to his hunger and his needs. (...) Keep away from hesitations and concerns of the conscience. And keep absolute calm on what I told you with honesty, because I told you in the name of our Lord. Remain in the presence of God by the means that I have indicated to you and that you know. Stay away from sadness and concerns because these are what prevent most from walking towards perfection. Dear son, place your heart sweetly in the wounds of our Lord, not forcefully. Trust with great strength in the mercy and kindness of God, he will never  abandon you, but not because of this you should stop embracing his holy cross very hard."

      "Would I receive the grace of Jesus to at least die in the place where he called me with such a paternal kindness? Such sweet hope sustains me and encourages me to continue living. Until then, since Jesus hasn’t wished that I consecrate my life to my beloved province, I have offered myself to the Lord as a victim for all the spiritual needs of it. This offer I have repeatedly and continuously been offering to the Lord. I am content t o see that, at least partially, my offer has been accepted. I hope the good Jesus will accept it completely. What could I tell you about the current state of my spirit? The terrible crisis to which I referred in my last letter grows every day. Currently, the soul is closed within an iron wall. On one hand, it fears to offend God with everything it does, and this causes great fear that can only be compared to the suffering of the condemned. Father, do not think that my statements are exaggerated? Reality is exactly such. One of these nights I thought I was dying. The Lord made me taste all the suffering that those condemned feel there in hell. But, on the other hand, what torments me the most is that, in such moments I feel in my heart how the desire to love God grows like a giant, and the wish to deserve his mercy."

In other words, we should abandon ourselves to avoid vanity, ire, and envy: three malignant spirits which hold most men as slaves.

      "Allow yourself to be lovingly guided by the divine providence, whether it wishes to make you walk at the level of the ground across deserts, or by the waters of sensitive and spiritual consolations. Hold your perfume in your hand, but if any other exquisite aroma presents itself, do not stop yourself from smelling it, giving thanks, because perfumes are supposed to remain around for a short time without consolation or spiritual  joy. Keep strong at any state in which Jesus wishes to place you so that your heart belongs to him completely, because there is nothing better than that. Therefore, leave behind, by continuously renouncing, all your earthly affections, everything that holds you  prisoner, and rest assured that the king of heavens will give you gifts to attract you to his holy love. I see in your heart a profound resolution to wanting to serve God and this assures me that you will be loyal to the practice of mercy and to the constant exercises that lead to the achievement of virtues. But I should warn you of something that you most ce rtainly know when offenses happen due to illness, you should not be surprised by it but rather, after repenting to the offense against God, it is necessary to seek joyful humility to find and to be aware of our misery."

You suffer but should lift your spirit because your suffering is with Jesus and for Jesus, and it is not a punishment but rather a test for your salvation. Therefore, be convinced and I can assure you that on the part of the Lord: Jesus is found in your pain and in the center of your heart. You are not far or apart from the love of such a good God. You experience in yourself the delight of the thought of God but still suffer because you are not close to possessing him completely and because you see the offenses committed against him by ungrateful beings. But it cannot be any other way, dear little daughter of mine. Who loves suffers. This is the constant way f or the soul that walks this earth; the love not completely fulfilled is torture, but it is the sweetest torture. You have experienced it. Continue, without fear, dear little daughter, being part of this mystery of love and suffering at the same time, if it is the wish of Jesus. This state is always temporary, divine consolation will come, completely and irresistible. In this state of afflict ion, continue, my good little daughter, praying for everyone, especially for sinners, to repair so many offenses committed against the sacred Heart. I believe that you offered yourself once as a victim for sinners. Jesus heard your prayer; he accepted your offer. Jesus has granted you with the gift of enduring such sacrifice. Then, continue for a little longer! Your reward is not far."

This was the invitation that made Saint Teresa say the prayer of the divine Husband: “Suffering or d ying”. It was also this invitation that would make Saint Mary Magdalene of Pazzi say: “Suffering always and not dying”. It was also due to this invitation that our angelic father Saint Francis, overtaken by ecstasy, would say: “Is so great the goodness tha t I hope to have that I delight in every moment of suffering”. Rather than lamenting ourselves in these afflictions and illnesses that Jesus wishes to send us, we should follow the divine Teacher through the path of the Calvary, carrying our own cross and, when he would wish to put us on the cross, in other words, to have us sick in bed, we should give him thanks and feel blessed for the great honor that he grants us, knowing that to be on the cross with Jesus is an act much more perfect than to merely contemplate him on the cross."

      "Father, allow me to vent at least with you: I am crucified because of love! I can’t stand this any longer. This is a very delicate food for someone who is used to ordinary food. It is precisely this the cause that I suffer from continuous spiritual indigestion, such that it makes the soul cry because of profound pain and profound love at the same time. The soul does not know how to adapt to th is new way in which the Lord treats it. And it is here that the essential kiss and touch -let me put it that way - which the most loving celestial father imprints in the soul still causes extreme pain. I hope that the good Jesus grants you to understand my true situation! And I, in the meantime, would ask you to please treat me with kindness for a little while longer and to talk to me about this. My most loving father, to satisfy the needs of this life like eating, drinking, sleeping, etc., becomes so very painful that I can only find appropriate comparison thinking of the torture experienced by our martyrs during the moment of their ultimate test. Father, do not believe that I exaggerate when I use this comparison, no, it’s exactly this way. If the Lord, in his goodness, does not take away my consciousness in the moment of these acts, as he did in the past, I think that I could not stand much time, I feel that I lack the support under my feet. I hope that the Lord helps me and that he frees me of such anguish! I hope that he is kind and that he treats me the way I deserve. I am rebellious and stubborn when facing divine actions and I do not deserve t o be treated in such a way at all."

I was very depressed but little by little the melancholy passed, and I started to feel more  motivated. Later, after praying at the feet of Jesus, I don’t think that I feel any longer the weight of fatigue that overtakes me when I am tempted, nor the bitterness of such temptations. The temptations that refer to my life in this century are the ones that touch my heart the most, they trouble my mind, they give me a cold sweat and -I dare to say - they make me shiver from head to toe.

      "Live at peace and do not worry about anything. Jesus is with you, and he loves you. And you reciprocate his inspiration and his grace which works in you. Keep obeying despite internal resistance and without a break, just the way it happens in obedience and  in spiritual life. Because it is written that the one who obeys should not have to report on his actions and should only wait for God’s reward and not punishment. “The obedient person -says the Spirit - will claim victory”. Always remember Jesus’ obedience at the Garden and at the Cross. It was with immense resistance and without consolation, but he obeyed even if he lamented himself with the apostles and with his Father. His obedience was perfect, and it was most beautiful w hen it was most bitter. Therefore, never was your soul more grateful to God as now that you obey and serve God in the aridity and in the darkness. Have I been cleared? Live in peace and happiness and do not doubt by any reason the word of who now guides your soul. From the way the divine mercy acts in you, you have all reasons to motivate yourself and to hope and to trust in God. Because this is the action that God usually has with those souls which He has chosen as his and for his lineage. The prototype, the model in which one needs to look and to model one’s life, is Jesus Christ. But Jesus has chosen the cross for a banner and that is the reason why he wishes for all his followers to walk the path of the Calvary arriving at the cross for them to later die laying on it. This is the only path to reach salvation."

What merit can my love have to God’s eyes? I fear tremendously that my love for God might not be true love.

      "What should be the symbol of a Christian? Let us listen to the Apostle of the people: “Would you actually ignore -says the saint Apostle, writing to the Romans - that all of us who were baptized in Jesus Christ were baptized in his death?” And don’t you rem ember that all of us who have been baptized in Jesus Christ have been baptized in his death? Therefore, when Saint Paul refers to baptism, through which we all become children of God and heirs of his Kingdom, is a model, participation and copy of the death of Christ. Baptism is a model of the death of Jesus Christ because, just like Jesus suffered  on the cross, the same way we are given baptism under the sign of the cross. The same way that Jesus was buried on earth, the same way we are submerged in the waters of holy baptism. Baptism is also participation in the death of Jesus because baptism applies the mysteries that it represents and, therefore, it produces the effects of the death of our Redeemer. The death of Christ is applied to us in our baptism in the same way as if it were our own death and as if we were being crucified with him. And it is in virtue of this death that our sins are being taken away, and the same for the guilt and punishment for such sins. Finally, it has been said that baptism is the copy of the death of Jesus. We, as Saint Paul would say, are baptized “ in morte ipsius ”, in his death, in other words, to imitate the death of our Redeemer. Therefore, what the cross was for Jesus Christ, that is baptism for us. Jesus Christ was nailed to the cross for him to die according to the flesh. We are baptized to die to sin, to die  in ourselves. On the cross, Jesus Christ suffered in all his senses. The same way, through baptism we must carry the mortif ication of Jesus in all our limbs. This is precisely what Saint Paul writes in his second letter sent to the people of Corinth: “We always carry in our bodies the sufferings of Jesus so that the life of Jesus can also be present in our bodies”."

      "We possess a double life: a natural one which was given to us because of Adam and a carnal generation, and, consequently, it is a worldly life, corruptible, a life that is our lover and that is full of low passions. The other life, a supernatural one, whic h we obtain from Jesus through baptism and, therefore, it is a spiritual, a celestial life, a creator of virtue. Because of baptism a real transformation happens in us: we die to sin, and we attach ourselves to Jesus Christ in such a way that we live from his very life. Because of baptism we receive the grace that sanctifies us and gives us a life, a celestial one. We become children of God, brothers and sisters of Jesus, heir of heavens. Thus, if a Christian dies in his first life through baptism and comes back to his second life, it is every Christian’s duty to seek heavenly things without worrying about anything related to things of this earth. The same is subtly said by the apostle Sain t Paul to the Colossians: “Therefore -says the great saint - since you have raised to death with Christ, seek matters of above, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God”. If at baptism a Christian rises from the death in Jesus, he is elevated to a supernatural life, he acquires the wonderful hope of one day sitting at the glory of the celestial throne. What an honor! His vocation demands of him to continuously wish to reach  the land of the blessed ones, to be considered a pilgrim in the land of the exiled. The vocation of a Christian requires not to put his heart on things of this world. All concerns, all efforts of a good Christian who lives by his vocation, are focused on seeking eternal good. He should judge things from below to appreciate only those that will help him reach eternal good and should judge as evil, all those that do not serve him for this goal."

      "A Christian should free himself of all these vices if he wishes to live according to the spirit of Jesus. Thus, all these vices and all these sins are part of the old man, the worldly man, the carnal man. It is precisely of this man that the Apostle wishes  that a Christian would get rid of: “Get rid of the old man by your acts”. Therefore, a Christian, dead and now risen with Jesus by baptism, should always try hard to renew and perfect himself, abiding by eternal truths and God’s will. In conclusion, a Chr istian should work hard to be like the Lord who created him. Christian perfection forces us to lead to that, and the Apostle urges us to do the same with the wisest saying: “Dress yourself with a new man who renews himself by the knowledge of the truth, according to the image of his Creator”. But who is this new man  of which the Apostle talks about in this saying? It is the man sanctified by baptism, who, according to the principles of sanctification, should live “in sanctity and in true justice”. We Christians are, therefore, the image reflection of God due to two reasons: by nature, because we are gifted with intelligence, memory and will; and by grace, because we have been sanctified in baptism, which imprints in our soul the precious image of Go d. Yes, my dear, the sanctifying grace imprints the image of God in us in such a way that we become almost a God by participation. And using the beautiful expression of Saint Peter: “In order for us to be part of divine nature”. See, dear sister, how great our dignity is. But we are great under the condition that we maintain the sanctifying grace. And how impure one becomes when that grace is lost. Our impurity is worse, I could say, to that of the beasts in the field. Everything disappears, everything is lost to sin."

It is a delicate flame so sweet that it consumes and doesn’t cause suffering whatsoever. It is so sweet and so delightful that the spirit finds such complacency and it feels satisfied in such a way that it cannot stop wishing for it. And,  Oh God! It is something so wonderful for me that I might never get to understand it until, perhaps, when I get to heaven. This desire, rather than depriving the soul of this greatness, reinforces it more every time. The joy the soul feels there, in its center, rather than diminishing because of the desire, grows more and more. The same could be said about the desire to perman ently enjoy this living flame, because such a wish does not get canceled by joy, but it rather remains much more alive because of the desire itself. From this you could conclude that, every time, there are fewer occasions in which it is possible for me to understand with the mind and to enjoy with the senses."

The greatest compassion that my soul feels when it sees a poor person causes, in its very core , an imminent desire to help him. And, if I were to follow my will, I would get rid of even my undergarments to dress him. And, knowing that a person is suffering, being in the soul or on the body, what would I not do in front of the Lord to see this person free of his pain? If I could see him free, I would happily carry all his afflictions, granting in his favor the fruit of such suffering, if the Lord would allow me.

      "Friday morning, I was still in bed when Jesus appeared to me. He was very sad and disfigured. He showed me a great crowd of priests, religious and secular people, among them were a few ecclesiastical dignitaries. Some were celebrating, some dressing themse lves, some removing their holy accessories. Seeing Jesus mortified made me feel very sad. Therefore, I wanted to ask him why he was suffering so much. I obtained no answer. But he looked at those priests and a bit later, almost fearful, and as if he were tired of looking, he stopped. When he looked at me, I was horrified to see two tears running down his cheeks. He walked away from that crowd of priests with an obvious expression of disappointment on his face, expressing: “Butchers!” and looking at me, he said: “Dear son, do not think that my agony w as of three hours, no, I will be in agony until the end of the world because of the souls that benefit the most from me. During the time of my agony, dear son, one cannot sleep. My soul seeks a drop of human compassion. Poor me! I’m left alone under the we ight of indifference. The ungratefulness and indifference of my ministers make my agony heavier. Poor me! How poorly they reciprocate my love! What hurts me the most is that to their indifference they add hatred, disbelief. How many times would I have been about to strike them down immediately had I not been stopped by the angels and by the souls that are in love with me…Write to your father and tell him what you have seen and what I have told you this morn ing. Tell him to show your letter to the provincial Father…”  Jesus continued talking but what he said I would never be able to reveal to any being of this world. This apparition produced such suffering in my body and even greater pain on my soul that I spe nt all day feeling defeated. And I would have felt like dying if the most sweet Jesus would have not already revealed… Unfortunately, Jesus has all the reasons to lament our ungratefulness! How many ungrateful brothers of ours do not correspond to Jesus’ love when throwing themselves with open arms to the infamous sect of the Freemasonry! We must pray for them so that God enlightens their minds and touches their hearts. Please motivate our provincial father and the Lord will grant him with celestial graces.

      "You ask me to judge your love for God. But my most beloved son, how is it possible that you do not feel this love yourself in your spirit? What other is that burning desire that you explain to me in your letter? Who has put in your heart that burning desir e to love the Lord? Isn’t it true that holy desires come from Him? If in a soul there would be nothing besides the burning desire to love its God, everything is already there. God is there because God is only absent where there is no desire for his love. T herefore, stay at peace regarding the existence of divine love in your heart. And if this hope of yours is not satisfied, if you feel as if you desire every time more, without being in possession of the perfect love, don’t take it as a proof that you are n ot loved by God, rather, remember that you should never say: enough! This means that you cannot and should not stop on the path to divine love and holy perfection. You know well that perfect love will be attained when the object of this love is possessed, which, in our case, is God himself. Therefore, why have so many concerns and useless disappointments? Do desire always and desire with greater trust, and do not fear. How is it possible for a soul that has consecrated itself totally to the celestial Love, who seeks to please it, with divine help, who desires and hopes each day more for the purest water of his divine love, how is it possible, I repeat, that it could leave this world, as a barren, cold soul, without the desire for God? How is it possible that this soul leaves this world with the sign of eternal failure? Doesn’t this seem like a contradiction?

      "Beloved son, be convinced of this: God can reject everything in a creature conceived in sin and who carries the indelible imprint inherited from Adam, but he cannot reject in any way the sincere desire to love him. Therefore, if by other reasons you cannot be sure of his celestial predilection, and if the  advice of who is talking to you in the name of God himself doesn’t make you feel better and comforts you, you should at least believe it by this sincere desire that you have for his love. I ask you, then, in the name of God, that you not feel defeated by this fear that you expressed in your letters. In other words, the fear of not loving and not fearing God, because I believe that the enemy wishes to trick you. I know, dear son, that no one  can love God in a dignifying way. But when a soul puts everything on its part, and it does everything with righteous intention, and it trusts in divine mercy, why would Jesus reject it? Isn’t he who mandated us to love God with all our strength? Therefore , if you have given all and consecrated all to God, if, consequently you seek to fill your heart only with God, and with a sincere and tireless reflection you are finding out the best way to serve him and love him, what reasons do you have to fear? Perhaps  because you cannot do more? But Jesus has not asked you yet for it and, therefore, he will not be able to condemn you. The Spirit of God blows when, where, and how it pleases. On the other hand, you should ask our good God to do for you what you cannot do . Tell Jesus: “Do you wish for a greater love from me? I have no more! Grant it to me then, give it to me and I will offer it to you! Do not doubt that Jesus will accept the offer and you can feel at peace."

This, dear father, is the wish that I could make for you, and I believe that it will be greatly received by you. Also, in such solemnity I will not forget, in my indignity, to pray to the risen Jesus for your beautiful soul. And would say that I will never  forget to pray for you. On these holy days, more than usual, I am severely tormented by the devil. I ask you, thus, that you pray fervently to the Lord so that I don’t remain prisoner of this common enemy. But God is with me and the graces that he grants me constantly are so sweet that I would not be able to describe them."

Lament yourself in a humble manner in front of Jesus, call often his sacred heart ev en until becoming inconvenient, but remember also that the answer he will give you through me, is not different from the one that he gave to the Apostle of the people: “Be satisfied with my grace”. Yes, remain vigilant over yourself, escape from laziness a nd from every vicious conversation, and, as much as possible, avoid frequenting people of the opposite sex, having always in mind the saying of the Apostle: your virtues are contained in a most fragile glass. Go often to your inner world and persist in pra yer, in meditation of celestial things and try to fill your mind with healthy readings of holy books. Regarding this last point, I ask you with insistence, to be constant and not to stop practicing this.

      "I hope that the humiliations of the Son of God and the glory he received from them be the object of your daily meditations. We should think of the renounce of the divine Verb, which -according to Saint Paul - “being of divine condition”, “living in complete  divinity”, did not consider a bad thing to lower himself to our level, in order to elevate us to the knowledge of God. This divine Verb, by its complete and free will, wished to lower itself until it became like one of us, hiding the divine nature under the veil of human flesh. Saint Paul says that in such a way the Verb of God humiliated itself, it was like annihilated: “ It destroyed  itself taking the condition of a servant”. Yes, dear sister, he wished to hide in such a way his divine nature that he acquired in everything the similarities with man, submitting himself even to hunger, thirst, fatigue, and, to use the same expression of the Apostle of the gentiles: “Similar to us, he was tested on everything like us, except by the sin”. But later on, the extreme humiliation was manifested during his passion and on his death, which, accepting with human will the will of his Father, he stood many offenses, up to receiving the most infamous of deaths, and death on the cross. “He humiliated h imself -according to Saint Paul -, obeying even until death and death on the cross”. This obedience was such for the dignity to whom he obeyed, because of the difficulty of the commandment and of the spontaneity to obey his Father in heaven. He was not motivated to do this because of fear of punishment, because he is the Only Son of the Fa ther, and neither because of having been seduced because he was interested to achieve a reward, because he is God in everything just like the Father.  This pleased the eternal Creator so very much that he exalted him “giving him a name -tells the Apostle -, which is higher than any other name”."

The eternal Father wished to submit all creatures to him: “Every knee will be bent in heaven, on earth and in the abyss to the name of Jesus”. According to the Apostle, Jesus is adored in heaven: to this holy name, the blessed ones in heaven, motivated by gratitude and love, do not cease to repeat what John the evangelist saw in one of his visions: “They sing -he said - a new song saying: You dese rve, oh Lord, to take the book and open its seals because you were killed and you bought us for God with your blood”. This most holy name is venerated on earth, because all the graces we ask in the name of Jesus are completely granted by the eternal Father: “And everything that you ask -tells us the divine Teacher - in my name to the Father, he will give to you”. This divine name is venerated, who would believe it, also in hell: because this name is the terror of demons by whom they find themselves defeated and destroyed: “In my name demons will be expelled”."

I am aware that in this world no soul can properly love its God, but when this soul does everything in its part and trusts in divine mercy, why would Jesus reject it? Hasn’t he commanded us to love God with all our strength? If you have given and co nsecrated all to God, why fear? Because you can’t do more? But Jesus is not asking for more. And, on the other hand, you should tell our good God to do what you cannot do. Say to Jesus: “Do you wish for more love from me? I have no more! Grant it to me and  I will offer it to you!”. Do not doubt, Jesus will accept your offering, and you shall be at peace."

No, my most beloved daughters, we shal l be strong, it is enough for us not to give up, using our loving will, deliberate, firm, and permanent. And this virtue of indifference is so sublime that not even our old man, nor the emotional human nature -as per natural faculties - have been capable of achieving such virtue. Not even our Lord could do it, who, as the son of Adam, even if exempt from all s in and everything belonging to himself, in this sensitive part, and according to human faculties, was not indifferent. On the contrary, he did not wish to die on the cross, because this indifference is reserved, when facing this kind of death of the spirit , to the faculties inflamed by grace.

Saint Paul also warned his dear Philippians when he said: “Do nothing for arrogance”. This great saint, filled with the Holy Spirit, could see in all its size the evil that this terrible vice could bring upon these holy Christians, if it achieved to get in their spirit, and therefore, he wanted to warn them: “Do nothing for arrogance”.

Before providing an answer to this question, it is necessary to consider that one is the substantial love to God and the other is the accidental love and that the latter is separated in sensitive accidental love and in spiritual accidental love. After making this distinction, we can go back to answer the posed question. The substantial love to God is the simple and plain act of preference, with which the will places God in front of all and every other reality, due to his infinite mercy. The one who loves God in this way, loves him with love of substantial mercy. But, if t his substantial love to God is paired with softness, if this softness is contained and it remains in its entirety within the will, we will then have spiritual accidental love. If such softness descends to the heart and it is strongly felt, with sweetness, we will then have sensitive accidental love."

When he sees that the soul has solidified its foundation in his love, and that it has fallen in love and has become part of him, seeing that it is no longer  part of worldly things and of opportunities of sinning, and that it has reached enough virtue to keep in his holy service without the rewards and the sweetness of the senses, wanting to take it to a sanctity of a better life, the Lord removes such sweetne ss of affections, which until then the soul had experienced in all its meditations, prayers and other devotions it performs. And what is most painful for the soul in this situation is to lose the ease of praying and meditating and of being left in the dark  in a totally and painfully deserted place (...).

Imitate Jesus in humility, both internally and externally but more internally than  externally, more felt than shown, more profound than visible."

And always remember that, when we will be in front of his divine presence, his every judgment will be based on charity. Make yours the saying of the great Bishop of Hippo: “My weight is my love”. Yes, weigh all your actions with the scale of love and you will be knitting a crown of merits for heaven. The boredom that you might experience when practicing this virtue and prayer should not scare you and neither should this make you give back on the practice of one or the other.  Keep working on it and this should not seem a waste of time because this time  is spent and lived in practicing obedience. Temptations should not scare you: they are the test to which God wishes the soul to be submitted when he sees it has the necessary strengths to sustain a combat that will allow it to obtain glory with its own hands. Divine grace will serve you as protection and support in everything."

      "Jesus tells me that, in love, he is who makes me happy. In pain, on the other hand, it is I who makes him happy. Therefore, wishing for good health would mean to look for happiness for myself and not looking for relief for Jesus. Yes, I love the cross, only the cross. I love it because I see it always on the shoulders of Jesus. Moreover, Jesus sees very well that all my life and my entire heart are totally devoted to him and to his suffe ring. Oh, dear father, forgive me for using this language. Only Jesus can understand how great my pain is when the sorrowful scene of the Calvary is in front of me. It is equally incomprehensible the relief that is given to Jesus, not only when sharing his pain,  but when he finds a soul who, for the love of him, doesn’t ask him for consolation but rather asks him to be part of the same suffering. When Jesus wishes to let me know that he loves me, he lets me taste his painful passion, the wounds, the thorns, the anguish… When he wishes to make me happy, he fills my heart with that spirit which is all fire, he talks to me about his delights. But, whe n he is the one who wishes to be loved, he talks to me about pain, he invites me, with a pleading voice and of command at the same time, to offer my body to alleviate his pain. Who would resist him? I realize how much I have made him suffer with my misery, that I have made him cry greatly with my lack of gratitude. I realize that I have offended him enormously. I don’t want any other but only Jesus. I don’t wish for anything (whi ch is the desire itself of Jesus) than his suffering."

      "Smile, because your suffering is according to God. If nature complains and asks for its rights, it is because of the condition of man who lives in it. If, secretly or quietly, it experiences the pain of the sufferings and it naturally wishes to run away fr om them, it is because man was created for happiness and crosses were a consequence of sin. As long as we live in this world, we will always feel the natural rejection of pain. This is a chain that will be with us no matter where we go. Rest assured that, if with our spirit at the highest level we wish for the cross and in the end, we embrace it and we submit ourselves to it because of our love to God, not because of this we are free of feeling in our interior the complaint of nature whic h does not wish to suffer. In such regard, who loved the cross more than the divine Teacher? However, even his most holy human, in his agony voluntarily accepted, asked for the cup to be kept away from him, if that were possible."

      "The path the apostle left for the Christian is that of getting rid of vices of the old man, in other words, the worldly man, and to dress himself with the virtues taught by Jesus Christ. Regarding getting rid of vices, he says: “Mortify your worldly limbs”. The Christian sanctified by baptism is not free from the temptations of the senses and of passions. Thus, the important need to mortify our passions for as long as we are in this life. The Holy Apostle himself experienced such a rebellion of the senses and passions, and that is why he, lamenting said: “I myself with the mind serve God and with the flesh serve the law of sin (he referred to the law of lustfulness)”. One could think he wan ted to say: I am a servant of the law of God with the mind, but with the flesh I am submitted to the law of sin. All this was said for spiritual consolation of so many poor souls who, assaulted by anger or by lustfulness, experience a painful contradiction : they wish not to feel or to have such movements, such resentments, or such vivid imaginations, such sensual feelings. Poor souls, without them wanting such, in them appear and are contradictory, experiencing a tendency towards violently turning into evil  when they want to do good. Among such poor souls there are some that believe to offend God when they feel such a tendency to evil. Console yourselves, chosen souls, there is no sin in this, because even the Holy Apostle himself, source of election, experienced in himself this horrib le contradiction: “I find in myself -he said - in the act of wanting to do good, a power that throws me to evil”. Feeling the stimuli of the flesh, even in a violent form, cannot constitute a sin when the soul does not choose about it with the consent of th e will."

Therefore, only virgin souls possess the happy condition of surrounding the Lamb and only souls that are virgin will follow him wherever he goes.

We are the preferred ones, the chosen ones among a crowd, and we want to know about such predilection, being that this selection has been made by God, without any merit of ours, from eternity, “ ante mundi constitutionem ”, with the only objective that we become his in time and in eternity, which is a great mystery and at the same time so sweet that the soul, even if merely absorbing it, can only melt completely in love. Secondly, let us ask for the Paraclete Spirit to enlighten us every time more about the immensity of the eternal reward to which the mercy of the celestial Father has designed for us. The anointing of our spirit in this mystery takes the soul away from worldly  goods and it makes us more desiring of arriving at the celestial land.

Indeed, the nothing, being the deprivation of the being, has no capability at all to resist the will of God, but a sinner, a free being, can oppose every divine wish.

      "What the holy apostle [Paul] considers the most important is mercy, and therefore, he recommends it greatly, more than any other virtue, and he wants it to be present in all actions, because it is the only and the one virtue that constitutes Christian perf ection: “And above all this -he says - keep the virtue of mercy, which is the link to perfection”. Observe: he doesn’t think it is enough to recommend patience, to tolerate each other, which are also noble virtues. He asks for mercy and rightly so because it could well be that one patiently tolerates the faults of others, one can even forgive received offenses, but all this can have no merit when it has been done without mercy, which is the queen of the virtues, and which encompasses all of them. Therefore, dear sister, we shall have great appreciation for this virtue, if we want to obtain the mercy of our Father in heaven. We shall love mercy and should put it into practice. It is the virtue that makes us children of the same Father that is in hea ven. We shall love and practice mercy, this being the commandment of the divine Teacher: loving and practicing mercy separates us from other people, let’s love mercy and let’s run even from the shadow of anything that could outshine it. Yes, let’s love mer cy and let’s keep always present the great teaching of the Apostle: “We are all members of Jesus Christ”, let’s remember that only Jesus is “the Head of all of us, his members”. Let us be kind to each other and let us remember that we have all been called to be part of one body, and that if we are merciful, the beautiful peace of Jesus will always be triumphant in our hearts."

      "Regarding the appropriate ways to achieve Christian perfection, the apostle [Paul] proposes two most powerful ones: the continuous study of God and to do everything for his glory. About the first way, he writes in Colossians: “Let the word of Christ live in you all with all its richness. Educate and learn with much wisdom, sing grateful hymns and inspired songs”. The teachings of this Apostle are clear, there is no need for comments. If a Christian fills himself with the law of God, which warns and teaches him to despise the world and its flattery, its richness, the honors and all that prevents to love God, he will  never be defeated, no matter what happens, he will stand everything with perseverance and with holy decidedness, and he will easily forgive all offenses, and he will give thanks to God for everything. Even more, the Apostle wishes that the law of God, the teachings of Jesus, be among us, abundantly living in us. But all this cannot be achieved without fervently reading the holy scriptures and those books that talk about things of God, or by listening to the holy teachers, confessors, etc. Finally, the Apostle wishes for the Christian not to be simply satisfied with knowing the divine law, but he wishes that the Christian would sharpen his senses, for him to find his way properly. All of this cannot be achieved without a frequent meditation of the law of God, through which the Christian, full of joy, bursts in his heart with sweet songs of psalms and hymns to God. From all this, the Christian who tends to perfection, concludes on how important it is the need for meditation. In regard to the second way, about doing everything for the glory of God, the Apostle says: “Everything that you do -he says - either by word or by action, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks through him to God the Father”. By this simple way, fervently practiced, we don’t only keep away from every sin, but we will also feel always motivated to greater perfection."

      "I have neither appropriate words nor appropriate feelings to thank the Lord’s mercy with which so lovingly treats you and protects you. I see clearly, my dear daughter, that He has chosen you for you to be close to Him, even though you have no merit for that. Rest assured, however, that He wishes to completely possess your heart, and he wishes your heart to be filled with pain and love like his. Illness, heart troubles, caresses, bliss, temptations, barrenness, and desolations  are tests of his indescribable mercy. When the enemy wishes to convince you that you are a victim of his assaults or of the abandonment of God, do not believe him, because what he tells you is a lie, and he wants to trick you. It is not true that you sin, it is not true that the Lord despises you, therefore it is not true that the Lord has not forgiven your sins and your faults of the past. Divine mercy is with you, and you are very loved by the Lord. Therefore, the shadows, the fears, any persuasion contrary to what I have told you are tricks of the devil which you should reject in the name of holy obedience."

      "Do not fear the cross. The most truthful test of love consists in suffering because of the loved one and, if God suffered so much pain for love, the pain that one suffers for him seems as kind as love. When the Lord gives you afflictions, be patient and be  satisfied by the Sacred Heart with joy, knowing that all is a continuous prank of the Loved one. Tribulations, crosses have always been the inheritance and the share of the chosen souls. The more Jesus wishes to elevate a soul to perfection, the more he increases the tribulation cross. Be glad, I tell you, when you find yourself so privileged without any merit on your part. The more anguished you feel, the more you should rejoice because the soul that is in the fire of tribulations will turn into fine gold, deserving to shine in the palace of heavens."

      "What hurts me the most, beloved father, is the thought of sacramental Jesus. My heart, before joining him in the sacrament, in the morning, feels attracted by a higher power. I could feel such hunger and thirst before receiving it that I could almost die of anxiety. And it is precisely because I cannot do anything other than uniting myself in him. Sometimes, feverish, I feel the oblig ation of going to feed myself of his body and his blood. And this hunger and this thirst, instead of being satiated after having received them in the sacrament, increase every time even more. And when I have in me this highest good, complete sweetness is so great that I could almost tell Jesus: enough, I can hardly do this anymore. I almost forget that I am in this world, my mind and my heart do not wish for anything more, and, frequently, and for a long time, also in a spontaneous manner, I c annot wish for anything else. But sometimes, the sweet love is also joined by the feeling of being oppressed in such a way by the pain of my sins which make me feel that I will die of sorrow. Here too the devil often seeks to make my heart bitter with the usual thoughts of great pain."

In these times in which we are continuously surrounded by people who have hatred for God in their heart and blasp hemy in their lips, the safest way to keep ourselves far from the pestilent contagion that surrounds us is to strengthen ourselves with the eucharistic food. Therefore, remaining without sin and improving in the life of perfection would not be achieved by someone who lives for many months without satiating himself with the immaculate flesh of the divine Lamb. I don’t know what others believe about this. To me, given the particular circumstances in which we live, it is always an illusion to convince ourselves that the one who limits himself to have communion one or twice a year is walking towards perfection."

The horrors of war churn my brain, my soul finds itself in extreme desolation. Although I had been preparing myself, I have not been able to avoid the horror of desolation, of which my soul is captive. This blessed war will represent for our Italy and for the Church of God, a healthy purge: faith will be renewed in the Italian heart, faith that was somehow hidden in a far corner, numb and dead by bad wishes. Faith will make flowers blossom in God’s Churc h, in an almost barren and dry land. But, before this happens, we will have to endure a difficult test. We must spend an entire night of darkness, so dark that our nation has never seen such until today. But, if for many this is an extreme test, like the stone that will make them trip over, for most people it will be a healthy medicine to regain health. Blessed are the eyes of those who will see this new day! In the midst of this test that we have started to take, and which for us is especially difficult, we should focus our eyes farther than this terrible darkness, we should concentrate on the day that w ill arise and this should be enough for us to find consolation in the most sweet Lord."

Until then, believe firmly, because it is true that God, who calls us to Him, watches how we walk, and he will never allow anything to happen that is not for our grea test good. He knows who we are and will extend his fatherly hand in difficult steps, making sure that nothing will stop us from running fast towards Him. But to enjoy such grace well, it is necessary to have complete trust in Him. Do not try to avoid this life’s accidents by being anxious. Avoid them with the perfect hope that, as we experience them, God, to whom you belong, will free you from them. He has protected you until now, it is enough for you to keep holding his providence hand and He will help you in every moment. And, when you cannot walk, He will guide you, do not fear. What do you fear, my dearest daughter? Being of God, he has so firmly assured us: “Those who love God receive only goodness”.

The more the soul knows its misery and its indignity in front of God, the greatest is the grace that makes it glow when learning about itself.

Beloved father, I can agree with the prophet: I have come to the high seas and the storm has wrecked my ship, I have screamed and tried in vain, my throat is hoarse and without success. Fear and shivers have taken over me, and darkness has covered me every where. I find myself lying on the bed of my suffering, full of anxiety, seeking my God. But where can I find him? From the bed of my suffering and from my dying prison I try in vain to go back to life."

      "There are some physical conditions whose treatment depends on a very specific way of living. Self -love, self-esteem, and the false freedom of the spirit are the roots that cannot be easily thrown out of the human heart. Only the production of their fruits can be avoided, which are the sins, because their first sprouts and their branches, in other words, their first shakes and their fi rst movements are inevitable while we are part of this mortal life, although they can be restrained, and their quality and strength can be diminished by practicing the opposite virtues, particularly that of loving God. It is necessary, therefore, to be patient when eliminating bad habits, taming dislikes and overcoming one’s mood inclinations and changes, because, my dear daughter, this life is a continuous fight and there is no one who could say: “I have not been tempte d”. Peace is reserved to heaven, where the palm of victory awaits us. Here on earth, we must always fight between hope and fear, but with the purpose of hope being always stronger, and having in mind the omnipotence of he who comes to our rescue. Do not ti re of working constantly, with trust and resignation, for your conversion and your perfection."

      "You should know, dear daughter, that mercy has three elements: love to God, affection for oneself, and mercy towards others. And my humble teachings put you on the path of practicing all of that. a) During the day, constantly do give all your heart, your spirit, and your mind to God with great trust and tell him along with the royal prophet: “Lord, I am yours, save me”. Don’t stop to consider what type of prayer God gives you, but rather follow with humility and simplicity his grace with the affection that you should have for yourself. b) Although without stopping with arrogance, keep your eyes very open regarding your bad inclinations to eliminate them. Don’t ever become afraid when seeing how miserable and full of bad moods you are, focus your heart and have a great desire to perfect it. When your heart stumbles, try to straighten it in a sweet and merciful way. In a particular manner, try hard to strengthen the upper part of your soul, without getting distracted with feelings and consolations, but rather with decisions, goals and objectiv es inspired by faith, the Guide and reason."

Don’t be astonished by the difficulties and situations which you mention with much suffering. No, dear daughter, don’t be s urprised.

This should be overcome only by desiring God, making that the holy spirit goes from the beings to the Creator, and with continuous hope of holy humility and simplicity of the heart. c) Be good to others and don’t let your impulses of anger control you. In such moments, repeat these words of the Teacher: “I love others, eternal Father, because You love them”, and you have given them to me as my brothers and sisters, and your wish that, be cause you love them, I should also love them.

      "The first virtue that the soul in need of perfection seeks is mercy. In every natural aspect of life, the first movement of things, their first inclination, their first impulse is to move towards the center: this is physical law. The same happens with supe rnatural things: the first movement in our heart is to go towards God, which is nothing but to love his own and true good. It is indeed not surprising that the holy scriptures call mercy the link to perfection. The virtue of mercy has as twin sisters joy and peace. Joy is born from the wish to possess what one loves. From the moment that a soul meets God, it naturally feels an impulse to love him. If the soul follows this natural impulse, motivated in turn by the  Holy Spirit, it is already loving the supreme Good. Therefore, this blessed soul is already in possession of the beautiful virtue of mercy. By loving God, a soul already possesses the virtue of mercy, because here it’s not like it often and unfortunately happens to those who love money, great honors, and health, one doesn't always possess what one loves. Those who love God immediately possess this virtue. This is not something I created in my mind, it’s the Holy Scriptures that say: “Those who remain in love, remain in God and God in them”. What does this phrase of the scriptures want to tell us? Doesn’t it mean that the soul guided by God belongs to God be cause of that love, and that by the same token, God because of such reciprocation belongs to that soul?"

      "Joy is an offspring of mercy, but to be perfect and true, this joy needs to have as a companion invisible peace, which happens in us when the good we possess is the greatest and true good. And isn’t God the greatest good that the soul loves and by loving him it possesses him? It is necessary, therefore, that this good, besides being the greatest, should also be true. The divine Teacher assures us that “No one would be able to take away your joy”. What is better testimony than this one? The soul, when thinking about this, cannot  feel but completely happy. This is the reason why a soul can face with joyful encouragement the most bitter tribulations. However, one should point out that, while the soul is in a state of searching, it will never be able to achieve perfect mercy, and its peace will never be able to be perfect either. Contradictions, tribulations are so many, the contrasts with which the poo r soul is mistreated are countless, making it agonize in certain times of its life, to the point of making it feel that life is unbearable, and this is caused by the feeling it has of losing its perfection. To resist such difficult tests, the soul needs to have patience, a virtue that makes us withstand adversities without giving up. The soul that seeks perfection as a profession should bear this virtue in mind, if it is concerned with uselessly working, beca use it is thanks to this virtue that it will remain internally under control."

      "Let us consider now what the soul should practice for the Holy Spirit to truly live in it. Everything is about the mortification of the flesh because of vices and lustfulness, and about taking care of one’s spirit. Regarding the mortification of the flesh, Saint Paul warns us that “those who are of Jesus Christ, have crucified the flesh of its passions and its hunger”. From the teachings of this saint Apostle one can conclude that those who want to be true Christians , those who live with the spirit of Jesus Christ, need to mortify the flesh, not for any other objective than for the devotion to Jesus, who for the love to us wanted to mortify all his limbs on the cross. Such mortification should be stable, firm, and not  only for a moment, but it should also last the entire life. Moreover, the perfect Christian should not be happy with a strict mortification only of appearance, but it should also be a painful one. That is how the mortification of the flesh should take place, because the Apostle, and with reason, calls it crucifixion. But someone could contradict us: why such severity against the flesh? Foolish! If you would think carefully about what you say, you wo uld realize that all evil that your soul suffers comes from not knowing and not wanting to mortify your flesh as you should. If you wish to heal at the bottom, at the root, it is necessary to dominate, to crucify the flesh, because it is the cause of all e vils."

      "Mercy, joy, and peace are virtues that transform the perfect soul around what it already possesses. Patience, instead, makes the soul perfect around what it withstands. What I have said so far is what is needed for the perfection of the soul. Virtues are needed for the exterior perfection of the soul, some of which have to do with the way in which the soul that tries to achieve perfection should behave regarding other peo ple, other virtues have to do with regards to the senses. Among the virtues that the soul needs regarding others we find, in the first place, kindness with which a devoted soul, by its amicable, courteous, civic conduct, not vulgar, captivates those with whom it deals and how it attracts others to imitate its dev oted life. But all this is yet too small. One needs to go into detail: and here is how kindness makes itself manifest immediately, a virtue that pushes the soul to be of service to others. And here it is good to mention two very important things for the soul who tend s to perfection. One of them is to see that others don’t appreciate the benefit received from the goodness one provided. The other one is, not only to see that others don’t benefit from the goodness that one provided them but worse, to see sometimes that t he goodness is corresponded by offenses and violations. The untrained soul experiences this situation often. and to see us run without our reward. Therefore, it is necessary that, at the slightest ambush, we arm ourselves with the beautiful virtue of magnanimity, which is a virtue that doesn’t allow our soul to ever back up when trying to achieve good for others, even when it sees that the other does n’t feel the benefit received. Against the second one, it is necessary to arm oneself with gentleness, which allows us to control anger, even when the soul feels to be corresponded with ungratefulness, with violations and with offenses. But all these beautiful virtues are still not enough if not joined by the virtue of fidelity, through which the devout soul acquires prestige, and which allows it not to fail in any action."

      "The virtues that make a devout person perfect regarding the senses are three: modesty, restraint, and chastity. With the virtue of modesty, the devoted soul manages to regulate every external movement. That is why Saint Paul recommends this virtue to every one and declares it necessary, and, as if it weren’t enough, he also wishes that this virtue be had by everyone. About restraint, the soul achieves to put aside all senses: sight, tact, taste, smell, and hearing, away from excessive pleasures, although leg al pleasures. With chastity, a virtue that elevates our nature to that of angels, the soul suppresses sensuality, and it takes it away from the pleasures that are forbidden. This is the most noble picture of Christian perfection. Blessed is the soul who possesses all these beautiful virtues, all products of the Holy Spirit who lives in it. It should fear nothing, it will shine in the world like the sun in the middle of the sky ."

One cannot doubt that this Apostle has been one of the greatest saints and almost a star of greatest magnitude for the holy Church. How many persecutions, how much suffering, how much effort suffered for Jesus Christ ! What burning mercy, what flaming love, what burning devotion for his honor! How many revelations, how many visions, how many ecstasies and abductions to the third heavens! However, the holy Apostle, filled with so many great virtues and of such extraordi nary talents, breaks in cry when quoted. The Saint confesses to have been stoned, whipped, many times, he has been in danger of sinking in the ocean, was taken day and night by the waves from one side to another: “Three times I have been whipped with stick s, once I was stoned, three times my vessel was wrecked, I have spent one day and one night drifting in high seas”. He confesses his many nights without sleep, his many fasting, hunger, thirst, the nakedness, and the punishment by the cold, all tolerated b y the love for Jesus: “Often nights without sleeping, hunger and thirst, many days without eating, cold and naked”. He claims to have been abducted to paradise having still been in mortal flesh: “He was abducted to paradise, and he heard unspeakable words that man cannot express”. He even claims not to live in himself any longer, that he only lives in Jesus, transformed in him by love: “I live, and I don’t live, but it is Christ who lives in me”. Now tell me, dear daughter, what does this great apostle and doctor of the gentiles lack to declare him perfect? He experienced an army in himself, formed by his mood states, dislikes, habits and natural inclinations, which conspired for his destruction an d his spiritual death. But because he fears all of that, he shows to hate it, and, because he hates it, he cannot stand the pain that makes him cry expressing an answer to his own question: that the grace God, through Jesus Christ, will protect him, not fr om fear, not from terror, not from the struggle (all things you feel, my beloved daughter), but rather from destruction, and that it will not let him be defeated."

I know that you immolated yourself and that you continue to do it for the Lord. Jesus accepted your immolation; Jesus has granted you the grace of receiving your offer. Therefore, be brave for a bit longer! The reward is not far from now. Do not be afraid, then, if you find yourself in the darkness and dryness of the spirit, because there is no reason to fear. There is no cause, due to a current or a past infidelity, to be concerned. Believe me because I do not lie to you. I encourage you n ot to be concerned by this situation, live your suffering in peace, because all of this is a pleasantry of the love of Jesus. Facing this situation, do not stop doing what you usually do, and rest assured that Jesus is pleased and knowing that your soul improves even without knowing and understanding it."

      "You are not correct, and you are not at all correct if you wish to measure the love of a soul for its creator by the sensorial sweetness that it experiences when loving God. That love belongs to the souls that are still in the simplicity of spiritual infan cy: a love that could be lethal for the soul that seeks it in excess. On the contrary, the love of the souls that have outgrown that spiritual infancy is the love that doesn’t receive goodness or sweetness in the part that we call the sensorial soul. A sure sign for knowing whether such souls really love God is to find them always ready to observe the holy law of God, to see them ready and vigilant not to fall in sin, it’s the usual desire of seeing the Father in heaven being glorified, making sure not  to stop, in any way they can, to propagate the kingdom of God. It is seeing these souls continuously praying to the Father in heaven with the same words by the divine Teacher: “Our father…thy Kingdom come”."

I trust that you will do this, because our great God, who has taken you by the hand to attract you towards Him, will not abandon you until he places you in his eternal temple. It would be good, my dearest daughter, whether you eliminate all pretension and thoughts of superiority, because the best way to achieve honor is rejecting it, but it, nevertheless, tempts the soul and it pushes it to commit mistakes against sweetness and humility."

This situation increased the pain I felt. I was also overtaken by a great dryness of the spirit, and I don’t know what would have happened if the one who I will mention had not come. The Lord appeared to me, speaking this way: “Dear son, do not stop writin g what you hear from my mouth, so that you don’t forget it later. I am loyal, no creature will be lost without knowing that. The light and the shadows are very different. I attract towards me the soul to whom I am used to talking. On the other hand, the tr icks of the devil seek to keep it away from me. I never cause fear in the soul to keep it away from me, the devil never causes fear in the soul so that it can come close to me. To know whether I am the author of the fears that the soul feels at certain times of its life about its eternal salvation, this can be known because of the peace and serenity felt in the soul…”. This vision and these words of our Lord have submerged my sou l in great peace and great joy that all the sweetness in the world, compared to a single drop of such happiness, seems tasteless."

I don’t know how to describe his voice when he reprimands me, but I do know that it is a very piercing voice for the soul that hears it and that it is almost impossible to reject it. Do not ask me, dear father, how I know that it is our Lord who shows himself in such a vision, when I see nothing neither with my eyes of the body, nor with those of the spirit, because I don’t know, and I can’t tell more than what I have told. I can only say: that the one on my right is our Lord and no other, and that, eve n before He told me, I already knew profoundly in my mind that it was Him. This grace has left a great good in me. The soul remains in great peace. I feel completely consumed by a most intense desire to please God. Ever since the Lord has favored me with this gift, He makes me look with great disdain everything that keeps me away  from God. I feel an indescribable confusion not knowing where so much goodness comes to me. My soul is motivated by the most vibrant gratitude to tell the Lord that He grants this grace to it without any merit whatsoever, and rather than from feeling superior to other souls, my soul, on the contrary, thinks that, from all the people in the world,  it is the least useful for the Lord. Furthermore, through this gift, the Lord has enlightened the soul in such a way that it cannot but recognize to be much more obligated than all the other souls to serve and to love the creator."

Resort with the most filial abandonment to Jesus, who will not remain without granting you  a drop of food and consolation. Seek Him always, even when the devil, to make the days of your life bitter, will remind you of your sins. Raise your voice to Him loudly, the voice of humility of the spirit, the voice of the contrition of the heart and the  voice of the prayer of the lips. During these situations, Raffaelina, it is impossible for God not to look at you pleased, for him not to provide, for him to give up. The power of God, and this is true, conquers it all, but humble prayer that comes from suffering conquers even God, it sto ps His arm, it calms His wrath, it unarms Him, it defeats Him, it satiates Him, and it turns him, one could say, in one who is dependent and in a friend. If all men could experience in themselves this great secret of Christian life, taught by Jesus with facts and with words, what a blossom of sanctity they would experience in themselves, the way Zacchaeus, the publican of the temple, Magdalene, Saint Peter,  many illustrious remorseful, and many pious Christians experienced!

      "What produces such desolation in your spirit is a most special grace, which God grants only to the souls he wishes to elevate to the mystic union. It is exactly that, dear Raffaelina. If I am not mistaken, the poor soul that experiences this grace, feels f ear and horror. Such a grace is a very simple, splendid, and clear light which, when penetrating the poor soul, finding it without warning and not ready to receive it, produces in it exactly what you are feeling at this moment. To give you proof or better, a comparison, a lthough it has nothing to do with the topic, think of an individual who suffers from an illness of the eyes. Such an individual, when looking at the light, suffers and he could accuse the sun of being an enemy of the eyes. Now, look at the sun, in general terms everyone prefers it to darkness, everyone says that the sun is good, is ideal, however, someone who is ill of the eyes prefers darkness to light, to the sun, and he would feel tempted to accuse the sun of being his greatest enemy. (...) I could conclude that the same happens to the soul, which is penetrated by such a light, it finds itself almost ill and unable to receive such supernatural light and, as a consequence, the poor soul, attacked by the light, is fearful, is terrorized in itse lf, its power, memory, intelligence and will. And, even if in an indirect way, such fears are also experienced by the interior senses of the body. But later, when the soul, little by little, heals itself of its inability, it starts to soon feel the health effects of this new grace."

Cling to it, thus, every time with a stronger will, with the highest of your spirit, and let nature feel hurt, let it burn, let it claim its rights, because there is nothing for it that is more natural than that. And if today nature is also subjected to suffering, such does not correspond to it by itself or naturally, because nature was made for happiness, but suffering belongs to it as punishm ent because of its guilt."

      "Which prisoner, when being tortured, although knowing to deserve it, would not feel the pain and torture and would not ask to be freed from such? Do remember this always, which is a general and sure rule: that God, while testing us with his crosses and with sufferings, always leaves in our spirit a beam of light, through which we can always maintain great trust in Him, and which makes us see H is immense mercy. I therefore encourage you to totally fall in front of the cross that heaven presents to you, and to maintain unlimited trust in divine mercy. Raffaelina, God loves you and he loves you very much, and you correspond this love in the best way you can.

      "Keep at your goals, stay in the ship in which the Lord has placed you, even when the storm comes. Praise be to Jesus! You all will not succumb. He will sleep but, in the precise moment, he will wake up to grant you calm again. Our Saint Peter, the scriptur e says, looking at the terrible storm, was so scared and, shaking, exclaimed: “Lord, save me”. And our Lord, taking him by the hand, said to him: “Man of little faith, why are you scared?”. Take note, dear daughters, about this holy apostle: he walks frail  over the water, the waves and the winds would not know how to drown him, but the fear of the winds and waves discourage him. Fear is an evil greater than fear itself. Daughters of little faith, what do you fear? Do not be afraid, walk over the sea among the winds and the waves, and do remember that you are with Jesus. What reasons do you have to be afraid? But if fear takes over you, scream with all your strength: Lord, save us! He will extend his hand, hold it tightly and walk with joy. In conclusion, do not over think about your faults, do not disobey, move forward with sincerity. No, God would not know how to forget about you, when you, in order not to lose him, persist in your goals. Let the world burn, be in darkness, in smoke, in com motion, but God is with you all. What, then, could we fear? If God is among darkness and on Mount Sinai, among lighting and thunder, should we not be happy knowing that we are near Him?"

It should be delightful -despite myself - but, what do you expect? My spirit is still hungry for  ordinary nourishment. I spend, especially during the night, moments of extreme anguish, seeing the test that put me at risk of losing absolutely everything. This period of most severe mortification and test, added to the already regular mortifications and tests, believe me, dear Raffaelina, often oppresses me and I feel crushed under such a tremendous weight. Sometimes I believe it is divine punishment for my countless infidelities to the divine kindness of the divine Majesty, and thus any prayers seem useless. Unfortunately, I deserve to be punished, but is it possible that the mercy of the Father of heavens be defeated by my malignity? No, this will never hap pen. Praise be Jesus!

I was giving confession to our young men in the afternoon of the Fifth, when I was terrorized by the view of a celestial being, which was presented to me before the eyes of the intellect. It was holding some kind of harness, like a very long sheet of iron with a very sharp end from where fire was coming  out. To see all of this and to observe how this character was violently throwing such a harness to the soul was indescribable. I could hardly cry, I felt like dying. I told a young man to leave because I was not feeling well, and I had no strength to continue. This suffering continued, without interruption, until the morning of the Seventh. I would not be able to express what I experienced during this painful period. I could see that even my insides were torn and stretched by that harness and that everything was  pierced by iron and fire. Since that day I have been fatally wounded. I feel, in the most profound of my soul, a wound that is always open and that makes me feel continuously anxious. Is this not a new punishment given to me by divine justice? Assess for yourself how much truth there is in this affirmation and whether I have all reason to fear and live in extreme anguish."

Oh, how the heart of the devout pilgrim beats when he diligently stops to pray! Each dark brick gathers the history of thousands and thousands of souls which, in trusting abandonment, have rested their heads and the anguishes of their lives. The pilgrim kneels there instinctively, and, in divine silence, feels that a most soft blessing fly over him. And the infinite and sweet prayer resonates, passes, and will pass, for many centuries: prayers burning for the love of saints, holocausts of the purest victims, tears of the redeemed. How great and sweet it is, in the Church of Jesus, the dogma of the communion of saints! This is no doubt the door to eternal life, as it is written at the frontispiece of the small and devout temple of Porciuncula."

The sisters walk to their posts, raise their minds to the Lord and await in peace… Then the crystal -clear voice of mother Saint Clare sings the Benedicite . The virginal hand raises, slowly and solemnly, to bless with a serious and miraculous gesture. On one occasion, there was no more than one piece of bread in the monastery, and it was time for dinner. Hunger stung the stomachs of the poor sisters who, even having succeeded in everything, could not permanently forget about the pressing needs of life. Sister Cecilia, the pantry aid, in a dire moment, resorted to go see the saint abbess, who asked her to break the bread in half, send one to the brothers who cared for the monastery, and keep the other half. She asked her to break that half in fifty pieces , as many as sisters there were, and give each her share at the table of poverty. The devout daughter then told her that ancient miracles of Jesus were needed for such small bread to be divided into fifty portions, and the mother replied: dear daughter, do  as I tell you with trust. The obedient daughter went on to obediently follow the maternal order and Mother Clare hurried to pray to Jesus in favor of her daughters. And, by divine grace, the small bread grew in the hands of the one who broke it, and every sister received an abundan t portion."

Saint Clare, teacher of humility, took the container, washed it, and placed it in the hole in the wall destined for that purpose, so that the brother who collected donations could pick it up. Later, she called him so that he could go look for oil. Brother Bentivenga hurried to help the poor sisters. But before he arrived, the container was found full of oil, by divine mercy, which had received the prayer of Saint Clare, who was obedient to the orders of the Saint Father (Saint Francis) who was always concerned about the needs of his poor daughters. The good brother, thinking that they had called him in vain, believed that they had called him to mock him, because the container was full. They looked around to see who could have brought the oil, but they could not find anyone around. This way, the Lord miraculously rescued those who had abandoned everything for Him, and obediently followed the will of His wife, who begged with a pure heart and w ith a faith that can move mountains. We too shall ask our dear Jesus with humility, with the same trust and faith of our dear Saint. Like her, we should pray to Jesus with devotion, abandoning ourselves to him, keeping away from the lying world, where everything is craziness and vanity, and everything happens.

They build their nests in a circular way, and it is known that sea water cannot get inside them. On the top of the nest there is  an opening, from where air enters. Seagulls keep their chicks there, which can swim and float safely over the waves without getting flooded or drowning. The air they breathe through the opening works as counterweight and as balance, in a way that small sw irls will never turn the nest over. Most beloved children, how I wish that your hearts be in a way that, on the sides they could be sealed, so that, when blows and storms of this world, of the flesh and of the devil surprise you, they could not get inside! And I wish that no other opening exists but the one on the side of heaven, to breath and to wish for our Lord Jesus. And this nest, dear children, for whom would be made? It is made for the little chicks of the one who has done everything for the love of God and who has been guided by his divine and celestial inclinations. But while seagulls build their nests and their c hicks are still too young to stand the blows of the waves, God takes care and feels compassion for them, making sure that the ocean does not drown them."

God himself tells us that He is with those who su ffer and are in tribulation: “With him I am in tribulation”, that He lowers himself to dry the tears of the eyes of he who suffers. Be consoled then, thinking that, after such dense darkness, a beautiful midday sun will shine,  and you will contemplate with such a light our celestial Spouse with a very simple and pure gaze. Do not imagine, dear sister, that you have been abandoned by the Lord and that there is no salvation for you. Reject that feeling which comes from our common  enemy."

A man of the people, he never hid his humble condition.  He was indeed the most supreme and good shepherd, the extremely peaceful king, the sweet and merciful Jesus on earth.  We will remember the good pontiff, more because we have an intercessor to the Most High than to raise our fervent prayers to heaven for the eternal repose of his holy soul.

      "Self-love never dies before we die.  As long as we live in this low world, we have to continuously suffer its sensitive attacks and its secret actions.   The grace of God should be enough for us to know that we do not consent with deliberate will.  The virtue of indifference is so magnificent that not even the old man, in other words, the man who has been subjected to sin, the sensitive part, or human nature with its natural faculties have ever been capable of achieving this.  Not even the Son of God, as son  of Adam, and even if exempt from sin and from all evident sin, was completely indifferent in his sensitive part and in his natural faculties.  He also expressed to the apostles that his soul was full of sorrow, he also sought consolation, he also wished not to die, in one word, he also wanted to experience everything that is part of human nature.  He wished, however, to practice indifference, and we can too, following his example, when tests arrive and we must carry the cross, we should try to practice it in our spirit, on the highest part, among the virtues granted by grace. Be brave, dearest daughter, live completely in our Lord and remain at peace.  When you happen to have broken the exigencies of indifference regarding, precisely, indifferent things, due to sudden impulses of self-love and of your passions, as soon as you possible can, lay your heart in front of Jesus and tell him with all trust and humility:  “Lord, I ask for your mercy, because I am weak .”  Afterwards, get up in peace and remain calm, and with holy indifference continue with your activities. In these situations, it is necessary to behave like a violinist.  When he realizes he is out of tune, he doesn’t break the string or leave the violin, but rather and right away puts his ear closer to the violin to find out the cause of the mistake, and later, patiently, as necessary, slightly stretches or relaxes the str ing. Therefore, act in the same way.  Do not become impatient with the mistakes you made or wish to break the string when you realize that there is something irregular, but be patient, humble yourself in front of God, sweetly stretch or relax the string of your heart to the celestial Musician,  so that He could fix what needs fixing."

All of this was instantaneous, like l ighting. And while this was happening, I saw myself in front of a mysterious character, like the one seen on the feet, and side. Its sight terrorized me.  What I felt at that moment is impossible for me to tell.  I felt like dying, and I would have died had the Lord not intervened to sustain my heart, which I felt was getting out of my chest. The sight of the character disappeared and then I saw my hands, feet and side pierced and with blood pouring from them.  Imagine the tearing that I experienced then and that I have been continuously experiencing almost every day. The wound of the heart bleeds continuously, especially from Thursday afternoon until Saturday.  Dear father, I die of pain because of the tearing and confusion I feel in the most intimate of my soul.  I fear dying of bleeding.  If the Lord does not hear the cries of my heart and does not take away from me this surgery, would Jesus grant me this grace, He who is goodness? Would He, at least, take away from me the confusion I experience because of such external signs?  I will raise my voice strongly to Him and I will not cease to beg so that through his mercy He will remove from me, not the tearing, not the pain, because I find that impossible and feel that He wants me to intoxicate me in suffering, but to remove these e xternal signs which represent for me confusion and indescribable and unsustainable humiliation."

      "The knowledge of your outrage and your internal monstrosity represents the purest light of divinity which puts into your consideration your own being and your capacity to commit all kinds of faults if you lack grace.   This light is a gift from divine mercy, and it was granted to the most perfect saints because it puts the soul under a shelter from all vanity and pride and it strengthens humility which is the foundation of true Christian virtue and perfection.  Saint Teresa also had this knowledge, and she s ays that it is so painful and horrible and it could cause death if the Lord would not sustain one’s heart. The acknowledgement of potential unworthiness should not be confused with the one of true unworthiness.  The first one makes a creature acceptable and pleasing to the eyes of the Most High, the second one makes it become despicable, because it is the reflection of the unworthiness present in one’s conscience.   You, in the darkness in which you find yourself, confuse the first one with the second one and, from the knowledge of what you could become, fear to be already what is in you only a possibility."

Jesus said: “If you do not become like children, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven .”  But before teaching us this with words, He had practiced this himself with facts. He became a child and was an example of such simpleness, being far from such.   Let us try hard to always have a mind pure in thoughts, righteous in ideas, always holy in intentions. Let us always keep a will that does not seek other than God and its glory.   If we try to improve in this beautiful virtue, He who taught it to us will grant us always with new lights and with greater celestial gifts. Let us always keep in front of our eyes of the mind our condition of priests.  And, until the day that we will be able to say to everyone with Saint Paul, without lying: “Be my imitators as I am an imitator of Christ ,” let us not stop improving continuously in this beautiful virtue of simplicity. But we will not move even a step forward in such a virtue if we do not try to live in holy and unaltered peace .  Sweet is the yoke of Jesus, its weight is light.   Therefore, we shall not let our heart allow insinuations from the enemy to steal our peace."

Peace is order, is harmony among all of us, is the continuous joy that is born of the testimony of a good conscience. It is the holy ha ppiness of the heart, in which God reigns. Peace is the path towards perfection, even more, in peace perfection is found. And the devil, who knows all of this very well, resorts to all means to take away our peace. We should remain very alert to the slightest symptom of concern, and, as soon as we are about to fall into despair, we should seek God with filial trust and with complete abandonment in Him. All our discouragements displease Jesus very much because they are always accompanied by some imperfection and always find their root in selfishness and self -love."

And also, on this matter we should be very cautious, we should certainly become saddened by our faults, but with a pain that should not take away our peace, trusting always in divine mercy. We should also stay away from reproach and remorse against ourselves because such reproach almost always comes from the enemy in order to disturb our peace in God. If such reproach and remorse humiliate us and make us conscious to do good, without taking away our trust in God, we should rest assured that they come from God. But if they confuse us and make us become fearful, wary, lazy, and slow to do good, we should be sure that they come from the devil, and, as such, we should reject them, increasing our trust in God. This way, keeping our spirit serene and at peace during difficult times, we will go very far in the path of the Lord. On the contrary, if we lose this peace, our effort to achieve eternal life will bear little or no fruit."

      "The shadow that invaded your spirit is nothing but the effect of the light that reflects when it moves away from your soul. But the Lord has made it possible for that reflection of light to be followed by a light much brighter and more intense. And this light is not different or better, it is the same that one day should unite the creature in celestial marriage with its creator. You should not be surprised if this most high light produces diverse effects and, I am about to say, almost contradictory, because it does not depend on the different dispositions and on the different states of the soul in which this is taking place. At the first  moment, this light penetrates the soul, and it leaves it in a state of suffering because it discovers stains that it has never seen before. Only in heaven it would have seen the ones he also sees now. Many are the reasons for the soul to find itself so saddened, but among them, one stands out which is the one that torments this chosen soul of God the most. The soul, as soon as it is penetrated by this most high light, sees God no longer like a loving fa ther, but as the most rigorous judge. And, further from being accused by God, the soul itself, full of terror, blames itself as the one and the only cause of such great misfortune."

      "This soul, so ignited by God, does not recognize itself at all as such. It believes not to love God and, as much as the poor soul tries to love Him, it thinks that the Lord does not accept its love, but that He even rejects it. From all this appears in its  heart a complete conviction that it will be rejected by God forever, without any hope for Him to return to the soul. However, despite such a conviction, the soul does not despair, its prayers to heaven are more persistent. Its knocking at the door of the divine guest is continuous, even when convinced that that door will never open, and that heaven will never extend its kingdom over it. Poor soul! How should it act to survive? Who does it sustain the soul? It should convince itself that God, whom the soul considers far, is within it and works in it, working with actions and efficiency equal to His love for all creatures. This is the sum, in honest words, of the current state of your soul. You have nothing but to accept, bless the hand of who leads you by a strange path, but a safe one that gives fruit to your spirit. Rest assured that, although the sky seems completely dar k and full of clouds, your spirit is very serene. This serenity you cannot see, and you should not see because God wants it that way and because this is the best for your soul.

See the way in which the holy fathers express themselves when they motivate the soul to such a reading. Saint Bernard, in his cloistral stairs, mentions that four are the steps or the means by which one climbs to God and to perfection:  he says they are reading and meditation, prayer and contemplation.  And to make his point, he resorts to words of the divine Teacher:   \"Seek and you will find, call and you will be heard .”  Applying such to the four means or degrees of perfection, he says that by reading the  Holy Scriptures and other holy and devotion books, one seeks God.  With meditation one finds Him, with prayer one calls His heart and with contemplation one enters the theater of divine marvels, open to the sight of our mind through reading, meditation, and prayer. Reading, continues to say the Saint, on a different reference, is like the spiritual food offered for the soul to taste, meditation chews this food with its speeches, prayer tries its flavor, and contemplation is the true sweetness of this food of the spir it which fully comforts the soul and consoles it.  Reading stops at the surface of what is read, meditation penetrates to the core, prayer seeks with its questions, contemplation rejoices in something that it already possesses."

It is enough to reflect upon the conversion of Saint Augustin e.  Who was the person who conquered this great man to the ranks of God?  It was neither the mother with her tears, nor the great Saint Ambrose with his divine eloquence, but precisely the reading of a book. Whoever reads the book of his confessions will not be able to contain the tears.  What a terrible battle, what furious confrontations he sustained in his poor heart because of the greatest rejection he experienced when he abandoned the obscene pleasures of the senses.  He says that he felt forced to cry, tied by his will almost like by a tough chain, and that the hellish enemy had his will subjected between the traps of a bitter necessity.  He mentions having experienced fatal agony when leaving his despica ble habits. (...) But while the Saint was being battled by such tumultuous desires, he heard a voice telling him:  hold this and read it.  He obeyed this voice immediately and, after reading a chapter of Saint Paul, soon the dense clouds dissipated from his mind, his heart's severity became softer, and his spirit felt complete serenity and delightful calmness.  From that moment, breaking away from the world, from the devil and the flesh, he devoted himself completely to divine service, becoming later this great saint that is  now venerated in altars. (...) Therefore, if the reading of holy books has such a power to convert the mundane into spiritual ones, how great the power of these readings must be to induce spiritual people to greater perfection!"

      "You tell me that the most venerated Saint Teresa of the Child Jesus used to say: “I do not wish to choose neither death nor life, let Jesus do with me what he desires!”   Unfortunately, I can see clearly that this is the scene of all souls empty of themselves and full of God.  But how far is my soul from an abandonment like this one!  I cannot stop the impulses of the heart.  However, father, I try hard to come closer to what the most venerated Saint Teresa said, which, on the other hand, probably is the say ing of all souls burning with the love of God. But being honest, I must confess that I do not follow this, as I must remain a prisoner of a body of death. I said this because in me there is no love to God because, if it were the case, being the spirit itself that makes this love greater, the effect wou ld be the same. To understand ourselves better, if the spirit acting in me were the same acting in Saint Teresa, the same saying would happen in me, just as it did in her holy soul.  Tell me then, do I not have reasons to doubt? Who will free me from this cruel tear of the heart?"

How could the tear of my heart be less, knowing that I am far from you?   My soul knows very well how terrible the battle was when you, my beloved, hid from me!

The senses remain suspended, except by the hearing which sometimes remains active. But this usually does not bother me. And I must confess that, even if much noise were made around me, I would not be disturbed at all. From this you could conclude that rare are the occasions in which I can use my mind to reason. And it happens to me often that, in moments in which my continuous thought of God, always present in me, moves away from my mind, I feel like the Lord, from time to time, hits me in the middle of my soul in a way so penetrating and so soft that, almost alw ays, I cannot but cry of pain for my infidelity and for the tenderness of having a father so good and so attentive to call me again to His presence ."

      "Many other times, I feel motivated by a vehement impulse.  I feel like God is completely smashing me, I feel like being at the threshold of death.  All of this is born, not as the fruit of some reflection, but of an internal call and of a love so unimaginable that, if God would not come to my rescue, in just a few seconds I would be consumed. In the past, with my efforts, sometimes I was able to calm such impulses.  Nowadays, I cannot control them at all.  All I can say about this, without risking being wrong, is that I do nothing on my own.  In such moments, I feel like the soul has the most burning desire to leave life and, because it seems like these desires do not find a response, it suffers the harshest pain, which is delightful at the same time, a pain the soul wishes never to end. The soul believes that everyone finds consolation and relief in their own suffering, while it is the only one that remains in the suffering.  The pain that has been penetrating the soul, exactly in its core, is so much superior to its nature that it would be impossible for it to experience if the pious Lord would not come Himself to tame His power with which the poor little butterfly is able to calm down and become more at peace.  And this happens, either because the Lord has granted the soul something that  it desires, or even because of the secrets that He sometimes reveals to it."

Perhaps the Lord, I think, could allow as punishment for my infidelities, that I, without knowing it, might fool myself and my spiritual guides?  And what should I do to overcome such a doubt when, by the light that I carry in my soul, I perfectly know my many faults to which I have always fallen, despite the many treasures of the Lord that I possess in me?! What I discover with truth and clarity is that my heart, also then, loves very much, much more than what my understanding could discover.  About this I have no doubt, and I am so sure about my love that, after the truths of faith, I am not sure of anything else more than I am sure of this. In this situation, what I can say with certainty is that I do not offend God more than usual because, thanks to heaven, I never lose trust in Him.  As soon as the Lord comes to visit me,  all of this passes, the understanding becomes full of light, strength and all good desires become more alive in me, and I even feel alleviated of physical illnesses."

And, if He does not wish to grant me any of those two graces, I hope that He will at least wish to continue to grant me the grace of not giving in to temptations.  Jesus, who did not measure His blood when He poured it for the salvation of man, would He wish to measure my sins so that I go stray as a co nsequence of them? I do not think so.  He will take revenge, soon and in a holy way, with His holy love to the most ungrateful of His creatures. And what do you say about this?

Walk with simplicity by the paths of the Lord and do not torment your spirit.  It is necessary, indeed, to hate your faults, but with a peaceful hatred and not with an annoyed or anxious hatred.  One needs to be patient with one’s faults and benefit from them through holy acceptance. Without such patience, my beloved daughters, your imperfections, instead of decreasing, would grow more every time, because there is nothing that feeds our faults more than the anxiety and concern of trying to keep them away.  Remember, dear daughters, that I do not like useless desires, as well as dangerous and evil desires, because, even if what is wished is good, that wish is, however, always bad in relation to ourselves, especially when it mixes with a proud concern, because  God does not demand such kind of goods but rather other ones, which He wishes us to practice. God wishes to talk to us among thorns, burning bushes, clouds, and lighting, like he did with Moses.   And we wish Him to talk to us in the sweet and fresh whisper like He did with Elias.

For the love of heavens, I beg that you calm your anxiety and your concerns about all this.  Live in peace and always move forward.  Do not let the statement that I tell you about the Lord stop you in this path: that you are halfway on your path to the summit of Calvary. You are in the darkest night, it is true, but the thought of a bright dawn and a radiant midday shall sustain you, motivate you and inspire you to always move forward.  He who has been sustaining you so far, no doubt, will continue to sustain you, every time with more patience and in a more pleasing and divine way in what remains of this rough and difficult journey."

Let us bless Him during tribulations of our spirit and tearing of our heart, because all has been decided by God with accurate precision.

      "To achieve our final goal, it is necessary to follow the divine Master who usually does not guide the chosen soul by a path different from the one He walked. The path of, let me tell you, sacrifice and the cross: “If anyone wishes to follow me, resign to y ourself, carry your cross and follow me”. And should you not feel fortunate to see yourself treated this way by Jesus? A fool is such who does not know how to access the secret of the cross. To arrive to the harbor of salvation, the Holy Spirit tells us, the chosen souls might walk and get purified in the fire of painful humiliation, like gold and silver in the melting pot, and this way redemptions for the other life are gained: “During suffer ing, remain firm, and in the difficulty of your humiliation be patient. Because it is in fire that gold and silver are purified, and men and women who accept God do this in the paths of humiliation”. God wants to make us holy at all costs, but He especially wishes to sanctity you. He is continuously expressing it to you. It seems that He has no other concern than to sanctify your soul. How good is Jesus! The continuous crosses He sends you, granting yo u the strength not only necessary but also abundantly, to withstand with merit, are sure and most particular signs of His immense love for you. The strength He gives you, believe me, is not wasted in you. I say this from God, and you should humbly listen t o me, staying away from any thought that tells you on the contrary."

And, following such a perfect example, do reform all your external actions, which are the loyal mirror that represents the inclinati ons of your interior.

Serving despite one’s own suffering means that, not being happy at all of the delightful satisfaction, they continue to loyally pray and act piously in the best possible way, and they trust that I will accept all in good grace because of my mercy”. L ater, the Lord added these meaningful words: “You should know, Gertrudis, that most pious people are such that, if I gave them spiritual satisfactions and consolations, these would not help them in their salvation and, further from increasing their merits,  they would work against them”. And such is, unfortunately, this way, I can show it due to the long experience that a soul has of being close to me. Therefore, my daughter, live at peace, because the day will come in which the Lord will also grant you to know the truth of what is told, o r better said, He will allow you to be convinced of such.

I t is true that such a soul might not believe us because it feels devoured by an inextinguishable thirst, insatiable. But what does this mean? Is this perhaps a proof that the soul does not possess God? It is completely the opposite. This happens because the soul has not arrived at the end of its journey, it is not completely submerged in the eternal source of its divine love, something that will occur in the kingdom of glory. Therefore, we wish to satiate the thirst with this source o f living water, and we should always go by the path of divine love.

      "God wishes to marry the soul in faith. And the soul who should celebrate such a celestial wedding should walk in pure faith, the only appropriate and unique means for this love union. The soul, to elevate to divine contemplation, should be purified from al l imperfections, not only current ones, something that is achieved not only by the purification of the senses, but also of all routine imperfections, such as certain affections, certain imperfect attitudes which the purification of the senses has not been able to eliminate and that remain in the soul as roots, and which is achieved by purifying the spirit. This is done when God, with the most high light invades the soul, pierces it intimately and renews it completely. This most high light, which God causes in such souls, places the spirit of these souls in a situation of suffering and desolation, capable of taking them to extreme pain and to interior suffering compared to death. In such a situation, these souls are not capable of understanding this divine action, this most high light. This happens to them due to two reasons: the first one, due to the light itself, which is so sublime and so marvelous that it completely overwhelms the capacity of the souls which makes the m feel rather darkness and torment than light. The second reason is due to the evil and impurity of the souls, and that is why the most high light does not only seem dark but also painful and harmful. Therefore, instead of feeling consoled, they feel torme nted by the light, feeling full of great suffering by the senses and full of great anguish and horrible pain at the spiritual level. All of this happens at the beginning because the divine light finds the souls not prepared for divine union, and, therefore, it brings them to a purification state. And later, when this light has already purified them, it takes them to the enlightened stat e, elevating them to the vision and perfect union with God. Therefore, the souls should be glad in the Lord for such a high reward to which He has elevated them, and they should trust completely in the Lord, like Saint Job did, as he too, in such a situati on, trusting in God, hoped to see the light after experiencing darkness."

      "Decembe r 6th Become motivated and be convinced that God is pleased with you and that He finds in you his peaceful dwelling. Do not wait for Mount Tabor to see God, you already contemplate Him, without realizing, at Mount Sinai. I believe that yours is not a troubled interior incapable of loving goodness. At this stage, one can only like supreme goodness in itself and no longer in its gifts. The thoughts of the mind, the involuntary distractions, temptations, etc., are products offered by the enemy, but because they are rejected by you, there is nothing wrong in this. When the devil makes noise, it is a good sign, it is a sign that he desires your will and, therefore, that he is outside your will. What should scare you, my beloved sister and daughter, is his peace and harmony with the human soul. During periods of the drought of the spirit, be humble, patient and resigned to divine will, and do not neglect anything that you usually do during times of spiritual joy, because true love is not about experiencing many consolations when serving God, but in a will always ready to do everything that God wishes to send us for our spiritual advancement and for His glory. Always believe in this, and do not worry if it is difficult and painful for your soul to believe it, even if you do not understand the reason for it. Even the martyrs believed by suffering. The most beautiful Creed is the one pronounced in sacrifice and causing us suffering."

But He cannot at all reject the honest desire to love Him. Therefore, if for other reasons you cannot be  sure of the celestial charity towards you, and you do not wish to believe me who speaks in the Lord, at least you could be sure by this reasoning. In conclusion, you can and should be at peace and happy. Believe me who speaks on behalf of God. Keep away from such fear, renounce such shadows with which the devil is attacking your soul to torment you and keep you away, if it would become possible, from  frequent communion and from the path of perfection. I know that the Lord allows the enemy such assaults, because His mercy makes you more pleasing to Him and He wishes that you are more like Him in the torment of the desert, of the garden and of the cross. But you well know how to defend yourself, keeping t he devil away and rejecting his malign insinuations. Have I been cleared? Be courageous and move on. Fight like a brave one and you will receive the reward of strong souls."

Reflect and keep always in front of the eyes of the mind the greatest humility of the Mother of God and ours, who, when the celestial gifts started to increase in her, she deepened ever y time more in humility, in a way that, at the same moment in which she was covered by the shadow of the Holy Spirit, which transformed her in the Mother of the Son of God, she was able to sing: “Here is the slave of the Lord”. And the same way, our belove d Mother sang in the house of Saint Elizabeth, even though she was carrying in her virginal womb the Verb made flesh. Your humility should grow while the gifts increase, believing that everything that has been given to us is goodness, in such a way that your spirit would break i n continuous praising. Acting this way, you will defy and conquer all the wrath of hell: the enemy forces will be destroyed, you will be saved, and the enemy will burn in anger.

You could also meditate on his birth, his fleeing and stay in Egypt, his return, and his hidden life in the workshop of Nazareth until he was thirty years old, his humility when he was baptized by his predecessor Saint John. You could meditate over his public life, his most painful passion and death, the institution of the most holy sacrament, precisely during that night in which men were preparing the most horrific torments for him. You could meditate also on Jesus who prayed in the garden and who sweated blood thinking of the torture that men were preparing for him and thinking of the ungratefulness of men who had not appreciated his goodness. Meditate as well about Jesus being taken prisoner and being judged, whipped, and crowned with thorns, in his way to the top of the Calvary carrying the cross, meditate on his crucifixion and, finally, on his death on the cross, amid an ocean of anguish, in front of the eyes of his most afflicted Mother."

The Hebrew people saw Him in the form of a cloud and like a cloud He appeared in the Temple. Jesus Christ, during the transfiguration on Mount Tabor, was first vis ible to the apostles and later He became invisible because He remained wrapped in a shining cloud. The fact of the hiding of God in the darkness represents something gigantic to our eyes because, from visible to invisible, He transforms in pure divinity. The fight with the enemy should not scare us: the closer the soul is to God; the enemy goes more to the bottom of us. Therefore, have courage. When speaking about darkness, I have also replied to your question of why the shadows seem to hit you more. They are not shadows, my beloved daughters, but light, and such strong and bright light that confuses the soul, which is used to think of God in a n ormal and almost human way.

This son is Jesus, and the ways of kissing him without betraying him, of hugging him in our arms without squeezing him, the way to give him a kiss and the hug of grace and love, which He expects from us, and promises to return to us, is, accor ding to Saint Bernard, to serve Him with true affection, to work on holy actions following his heavenly teachings, which we profess in words.

Dear daughter, who could tell me the incredible secrets hidden under the veil of the words expressed by the wife of the Song of Songs? I would try in vain, even if I wanted to explain all the wonderful secrets. What I can say is that the soul, when the Lor d allows it to say such words, as the wife expressed in the Song of Songs, it feels such sweetness that it realizes that Jesus holds it close to him. All its faculties remain then in calm in a way that it seems to possess God as much as it desires Him. It seems to touch with its hand the nothing that is all the things of this world. The divine Spouse starts showing the soul the most important truths in a way, and for sure new. But the soul does not see this divine lover that manifests itself this way, it only knows that He is with it, and it cannot doubt this at all. The soul finds it self in a place so bright, it experiences such incredible effects of the union with the Spouse, and it feels very firm in the virtue that it feels to be a different soul from before. It lives submerged in this ocean of consolation completely heavenly that,  in the drunkenness of its joy, it does not know what to desire or ask God. In conclusion, in this stream of light and happiness the soul does not know what has transformed. It feels it has been transported outside of itself. It feels that the divine Spouse hugs it so close to Him that the poor soul, in front of such joy, feels li ke fainting in a way. It is precisely at that moment that it feels like being lovingly taken in the divine arms, and that He squeezes it next to His side, to His divine chest, and it is such the celestial drunkenness of the soul that it becomes overwhelmed  and almost out of itself. So, in an impulse of holy craziness, the soul could tell its sweet conqueror: “your embracing chest is better than wine with an aroma more exquisite than perfumes”."

Live in a way that the celestial Father could be proud of you, as He does with so many souls that He has chosen the same way that He chose yours. Live in a way that you could repeat every moment with the apostle Saint Paul: “Imitate me, like me who is Chri st Jesus”. Live in a way, I repeat, that even the world could firmly say: “That is Christ”. Oh, I ask mercifully, do not think that this is exaggeration! Every Christian, true imitator, and follower of the Nazarene can and should call himself a second Chri st, of whom he carries very importantly His footprint. Oh, if every Christian would live according to his vocation, this world of exile would become a paradise ."

      "I am totally aware that there is nothing in me that could attract the eyes of our most sweet Jesus. It has only been his mercy that has filled my soul with so many goods. He almost never lets me out of his sight, He follows me everywhere, gives life to my life poisoned by sin. He makes dense clouds dissipate, in which my soul is wrapped after sinning. As soon as I close my eyes, I see the night come down, I see paradise opening to me and, happy by such a vision, I sleep with a smile of happiness on my lips and a complete peace on my forehead, waiting for my small childhood friend to come to wake me up, so that we could sing together early praises to the beloved of our hearts. Oh, my dear father, if after knowing my reality, you feel compassion, I beg you to please, please pray and tell this to my beloved, on my behalf, as proof of my love and gratitude."
