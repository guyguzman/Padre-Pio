I have a 366 page pdf file where each page stands alone.

I want to extract the text of each page and place into a JSON file. 
The JSON file will be an array of 366 objects. 
Each object will be a page.
Each page will have a page number, text and metadata fields. 
Page number will be sequential starting at 1. 
Extract the text in the natural reading order.

Ignore any blocks of text that contain a month name and do not contain a '('.
If a section of text contains this '(' followed by a month name, it will be considered metadata and added to the JSON.
Any text that does not contain a month name will be considered bodytext.

For the bodytext, separate the text into paragraphs by infering by the extra vertical spacing. 
Remove any line feeds. 
Group the sentences of each paragraph into a single string. A paragraph is a group of sentences separated from
other paragraphs by some vertical space. Add each paragraphto the paragraphs array.

Can you create the python code to extract the valid text of where each page is a member of an JSON array. 
For each page, the individual paragraphs are in their own array named paragraphs and the last the text block is named metadata. 
The input file is 'padrePioLetters.pdf' and the output json file is 'padrePioLetters.json'.
